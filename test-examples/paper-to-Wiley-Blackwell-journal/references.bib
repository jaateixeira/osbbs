To better understand how decision making in alliances may influence success, we use an experimental design that juxtaposes two important factors that affect alliance members' decisions: economic incentives and communication. The evidence from our experiment sheds light on the relative impact of each, and more importantly, how both factors interact to explain successful outcomes.

  abstract = {Strategic alliances are important channels for interfirm learning, especially for small firms that are resource constrained. Of the several alliance attributes, technological distance between partners (measured as the distance between partners’ innovative outcomes) is shown to have a significant influence on the learning benefits from strategic alliances. Drawing upon the theory of recombination, our study argues that the influence of technological distance on learning is best understood by not only measuring the distance between innovative outcomes, but by also taking into consideration the knowledge elements underlying the innovative outcomes. We develop a concept of knowledge base homogeneity that captures the extent to which the innovative outcomes of partnering firms draw upon similar sets of knowledge elements. Using patent and alliance data from 201 small biotechnology firms during the period 1996–2010, we confirm that the technological distance has an inverted u-shaped relationship on interfirm learning. We further demonstrate that this u-shaped relationship is moderated by the knowledge base homogeneity between partners, such that benefits of technological distance are enhanced and the costs of technological distance are mitigated when the knowledge base homogeneity between alliance partners is high. The results have important implications for interfirm learning, especially in the context of small firms that are limited in their knowledge stocks.},

@article{AdnerKapoor2010,
  abstract = {Abstract The success of an innovating firm often depends on the efforts of other innovators in its environment. How do the challenges faced by external innovators affect the focal firm's outcomes? To address this question we first characterize the external environment according to the structure of interdependence. We follow the flow of inputs and outputs in the ecosystem to distinguish between upstream components that are bundled by the focal firm, and downstream complements that are bundled by the firm's customers. We hypothesize that the effects of external innovation challenges depend not only on their magnitude, but also on their location in the ecosystem relative to the focal firm. We identify a key asymmetry that results from the location of challenges relative to a focal firm—greater upstream innovation challenges in components enhance the benefits that accrue to technology leaders, while greater downstream innovation challenges in complements erode these benefits. We further propose that the effectiveness of vertical integration as a strategy to manage ecosystem interdependence increases over the course of the technology life cycle. We explore these arguments in the context of the global semiconductor lithography equipment industry from its emergence in 1962 to 2005 across nine distinct technology generations. We find strong empirical support for our framework. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \\& Sons, Ltd.},

We do not see “network dynamics” as a single construct; rather, it is an umbrella term covering a wide territory. In the first phase of our two-phase review, we present a taxonomy that organizes this territory into three categories: (1) network change (i.e., the emergence, evolution, and transformation of network ties and structures), (2) the occurrence of relational events (i.e., modeling the sequence of discrete actions generated by one actor and directed towards one or more other actors), and (3) coevolution (i.e., the process whereby network and actor attributes influence each other over time). Our review highlights differences between network dynamics based on relational states (e.g., a friendship) and relational events (e.g., an email message), examines the drivers and effects of network dynamics, and in a methodological appendix, clarifies the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of different analytical approaches for studying network dynamics. In the second phase of our review, we critically reflect on the findings from the first phase and sketch out a rough agenda for future research, organized in terms of four overarching themes: the interplay between the dynamics of social networks conceived as relational states and relational events, mechanisms underlying network dynamics, outcomes of network dynamics, and the role of cognition.},

First, we identify distinct types of platforms. Our analysis of a wide range of industry examples suggests that there are two predominant types of platforms: internal or company-specific platforms, and external or industry-wide platforms. We define internal (company or product) platforms as a set of assets organized in a common structure from which a company can efficiently develop and produce a stream of derivative products. We define external (industry) platforms as products, services, or technologies that act as a foundation upon which external innovators, organized as an innovative business ecosystem, can develop their own complementary products, technologies, or services. Second, we summarize from the literature general propositions on the design, economics, and strategic management of platforms. Third, we review the case of Intel and other examples to illustrate the range of technological, strategic, and business challenges that platform leaders and their competitors face as markets and technologies evolve. Finally, we identify practices associated with effective platform leadership and avenues for future research to deepen our understanding of this important phenomenon and what firms can do to manage platform-related competition and innovation.},

This is especially true in ecosystems, in which firms depend on one another to collectively provide components and create value for consumers. Through an in-depth multiple case study of five firms in the U.S. residential solar industry from 2007 to 2014, we induct a theoretical framework that explains how firms navigate nascent ecosystems over time. We identify three strategies, each with a distinct balance of cooperation and competition, as well as unique advantages, disadvantages, and required capabilities. Overall, we contribute to research on ecosystem strategy, crystallize the pivotal role of bottlenecks, and shed light on the dynamic interplay of cooperation and competition. Managerial Summary Competition and cooperation are fundamental to strategy, and often closely intertwined. But how firms navigate and balance cooperation and competition over time, especially in ecosystems where firms depend on one another to deliver value to consumers, is unclear. In this article, we conduct an in-depth multiple-case study of five firms in the U.S. residential solar industry to examine how firms can successfully navigate nascent ecosystems over time. We identify three distinct strategies, each with a distinct balance of cooperation and competition, and examine the unique advantages, disadvantages, and required capabilities of each.

  abstract = {Research Summary: The recent surge of interest in “ecosystems” in strategy research and practice has mainly focused on what ecosystems are and how they operate. We complement this literature by considering when and why ecosystems emerge, and what makes them distinct from other governance forms. We argue that modularity enables ecosystem emergence as it allows a set of distinct yet interdependent organizations to coordinate without full hierarchical fiat. We show how ecosystems address multilateral dependences based on various types of complementarities—supermodular or unique, unidirectional or bidirectional—which determine the ecosystem's value-add. We argue that at the core of ecosystems lie nongeneric complementarities, and the creation of sets of roles that face similar rules. We conclude with implications for mainstream strategy and suggestions for future research. Managerial Summary: We consider what makes ecosystems different from other business constellations, including markets, alliances, or hierarchically managed supply chains. Ecosystems, we posit, are interacting organizations, enabled by modularity, not hierarchically managed, bound together by the nonredeployability of their collective investment elsewhere. Ecosystems add value as they allow managers to coordinate their multilateral dependence through sets of roles that face similar rules, thus obviating the need to enter into customized contractual agreements with each partner. We explain how different types of complementarities (unique or supermodular, generic or specific, uni- or bi-directional) shape ecosystems and offer a “theory of ecosystems” that can explain what they are, when they emerge, and why alignment occurs. Finally, we outline the critical factors affecting ecosystem emergence, evolution, and success—or failure.},

  abstract = {Digital platforms can be opened in two ways to promote innovation and value generation. A platform owner can open access for third-party participants by establishing boundary resources, such as APIs and an app store, to allow complements to be developed and shared for the platform. Furthermore, to foster cooperation with the complementors, the platform owner can use an open-source license boundary resource to open and share the platform’s core resources. However, openness that is too wide renders the platform and its shared resources vulnerable to strategic exploitation. To our knowledge, platform strategies that promote such negative outcomes have remained unexplored in past research. We identify and analyze a prominent form of strategic exploitation called platform forking in which a hostile firm, i.e., a forker, bypasses the host’s controlling boundary resources and exploits the platform’s shared resources, core and complements, to create a competing platform business. We investigate platform forking on Google’s Android platform, a successful open digital platform, by analyzing the fate of five Android forks and related exploitative activities. We observe several strategies that illustrate alternative ways of bundling a platform fork from a set of host, forker, and other resources. We also scrutinize Google’s responses, which modified Android’s boundary resources to curb exploitation and retain control. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we present a theorization of the competitive advantage of open digital platforms and specifically expose platform forking as an exploitative and competitive platform strategy. Second, we extend platform governance literature by showing how boundary resources, which are mainly viewed as cooperative governance mechanisms, are also used to combat platform forking and thus sustain a platform’s competitive advantage.},

We ground our study in theories of complex systems, strategy dynamics, and industry life cycle. Using a unique longitudinal dataset, we define and develop graph and information theoretic measures of coopetition, convergence, complexity, and velocity of the ICT ecosystem. We frame the “transformation path” of the ICT ecosystem using these proposed metrics and map the trajectory using complex network visualizations. Our results show that while segments in the ICT ecosystem have converged, the rate of convergence is decreasing. This suggests a growing maturity of the ecosystem and decreasing importance on formal interfirm relationships. At the same time, we find that coopetition is increasing at a decreasing rate. We also find evidence of a declining engagement in interfirm R\&D and a growing number of technology transfer relationships, indicating a possible shift from value exploration to value capturing. Our novel data-based metrics provide a foundation for strategic analysis of new business opportunities that is not possible using traditional market analysis tools. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and future research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Enterprise systems software (ESS) is a multibillion dollar industry that produces systems components to support a variety of business functions for a widerange of vertical industry segments. Even if it forms the core of an organization's information systems (IS) infrastructure, there is little prior IS research on the competitive dynamics in this industry. Whereas economic modeling has generally provided the methodological framework for studying standards-driven industries, our research employs social network methods to empirically examine ESS firm competition. Although component compatibility is critical to organizational end users, there is an absence of industry-wide ESS standards and compatibility is ensured through interfirm alliances. First, our research observes that this alliance network does not conform to the equilibrium structures predicted by economics of network evolution supporting the view that it is difficult to identify dominant standards and leaders in this industry. This state of flux combined with the multifirm multicomponent nature of the industry limits the direct applicability of extant analytical models. Instead, we propose that the relative structural position acquired by a firm in its alliance network is a reasonable proxy for its standards dominance and is an indicator of its performance. In lieu of structural measures developed mainly for interpersonal networks, we develop a measure of relative firm prominence specifically for the business software network where benefits of alliances may accrue through indirect connections even if attenuated. Panel data analyses of ESS firms that account for over 95\\% of the industry revenues, show that our measure provides a superior model fit to extant social network measures. Two interesting counterintuitive findings emerge from our research. First, unlike other software industries compatibility considerations can trump rivalry concerns. We employ quadratic assignment procedure to show that firms freely form alliances even with their rivals. Second, we find that smaller firms enjoy a greater value from acquiring a higher structural position as compared to larger firms.},

We first systematize diverse conceptualizations of coopetition with respect to different levels into The Actor and The Activity Schools of Thought. Then we integrate major critical themes into a Driver, Process, Outcomes (DPO) framework, and offer a Blended School of Thought to show how different levels are intertwined and affect each other. Next, we develop a multilevel conceptual model of coopetition by integrating the Blended School into the DPO framework. This model helps future research better understand how the phenomena of coopetition at one level of analysis are distinct, yet interlinked, from coopetition at other levels, and in so doing, provides a richer and more complete perspective of the phenomenon of coopetition.

In particular, our results show that competitor collaboration has a significant positive impact on product innovation performance only when internal knowledge sharing mechanisms and formal knowledge protection mechanisms are present. These findings contribute to the emerging contingency perspective on coopetition and provide specific recommendations to managers that are involved in coopetitive endeavors.},

Despite the constantly growing number of scientific publications, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and critical overview of past and present research accomplishments. Based on the first citation analysis in this field, we present three topical clusters which help us to indicate the evolution path of coopetition research. Additionally, the current literature state is studied by means of a systematic literature review reflecting the major research avenues. By combining and comparing the results of these two analyses, the paper concludes by proposing possible future research directions. To advance our current understanding of coopetition, we suggest that forthcoming research explores coopetition in the contexts of startups and family firms and extends our knowledge on the protection mechanisms which are necessary for coopeting successfully.},

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted bibliometric analyses of citation and co-citation analysis. The units of analysis were original research articles and research notes retrieved from journals indexed by well-known databases. Keywords used in the search were “co-opet, co-opet, coopetition, coopetition, simultaneous cooperation and competition, simultaneously cooperate and compete, coexistence of cooperation and competition, coexistence of cooperation and competition, cooperate and compete simultaneously, coopetitive relationships, coopetitive relationships, coopetitive networks, horizontal alliances, cooperate with competitors, cooperation with competitors, cooperative relationships with competitors, cooperative competition and competitive cooperation.” Regarding the time period for publication of the sample articles, the authors did not place any restrictions. Findings The research findings provide evidence that coopetition demonstrates multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary characteristics. Subfields of the coopetition field were identified based on the components of coopetition, which are relation, process and strategy. The component dealing with relationship management and innovation as strategy become prominent. Although coopetition literature has emerged as a relation view of strategy, it is still fragmented and diverse. Additionally, the robust subfields generated from the analysis were super-positioned with low degrees.

Yet, the knowledge gained by cooperation may also be used for competition. However, there is little investigation of how this problem may be modelled and, hence, managed. A game–theoretic framework for analysing interorganisational knowledge sharing under co-opetition and guidelines for the management of explicit knowledge predicated on coordination and control theory has been proposed, but remains untested. This research empirically investigates these issues in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs provide an interesting setting as they are knowledge generators, but are poor at knowledge exploitation.

We argue that the capability to interact with other companies-which we call relational capability-accelerates the lead firm's knowledge access and transfer with relevant effects on company growth and innovativeness. This study provides evidence that interfirm networks can be shaped and deliberately designed: over time managers develop a specialized supplier network and build a narrower and more competitive set of core competencies. The ability to integrate knowledge residing both inside and outside the firm's boundaries emerges as a distinctive organizational capability. Our main goal is to contribute to the current discussion of cooperative ties and dynamic aspects of interfirm networks, adding new dimensions to resource-based and knowledge-based interpretations of company performance.},

Temporal distancing captures the perceived difficulties to connect recalled competitive pasts and imagined cooperative futures, whereas referencing re-imagined pasts and futures enables a connection, i.e. temporal integration, informing managerial actions and coopetition decision-making. First, our study extends theoretical insights on how tensions manifest through managerial sensemaking. Second, we contribute to research on individual level coping strategies part of the coopetition capability concept by showing that managerial mindsets encompass continuous re-imaginations of cooperative and competitive pasts, presents and futures.

In particular, collaborating with competitors (coopetition) has been found to be an effective way of creating both incremental and radical innovations, especially in high-tech industries. However, coopetition also includes some major risks and disadvantages, which makes it undesirable in certain cases. The focus in this study is on the factors that distinguish coopetition from collaboration. We propose that the ability of a firm to reap benefits in innovation-related coopetition is contingent on factors that enable collective value creation, and on those that facilitate the individual isolation of the innovations and any subsequent profits. Further, we suggest that the effectiveness of these factors depends on the novelty of the innovation with respect to current markets and technology. In explicitly analyzing such issues we aim to expand current understanding of how firms can create and appropriate value in collaborative R\&D and innovation with competitors as specific partners.},

In order to improve our understanding of coopetition activities, we use the strategy-as-practice approach and integrate it with coopetition research. The empirical part of this study is based on a single qualitative case study of a coopetitive relationship between a large multinational company and its supplier. The findings show how praxis on the micro level influences, and is influenced by, practices on the meso and macro levels.

While companies increasingly engage in multi-sourcing arrangements, theoretical insights into this important phenomenon are scarce. Drawing on the coopetition and multi-sourcing literatures, we introduce the concept of forced coopetition (i.e., the situation where a third party forces competitors to cooperate) to describe the vendor relationships in IT multi-sourcing models. As an illustration, we present the case of a global sports company that recently introduced a novel IT multi-sourcing model, which is characterized by high levels of both vendor competition and cooperation, i.e., high levels of forced coopetition. Based on a longitudinal case study, we discuss the factors that enabled the client firm to (1) foster vendor competition and cooperation as well as (2) manage the delicate balance between the two. Specifically, we find that vendor number and size, vendor onboarding, vendor business growth, and vendor learning played a critical role in the successful implementation of the multi-sourcing model. The study’s main contributions lie in providing a deeper understanding of how client firms can manage the delicate balance between vendor competition and cooperation in IT multi-sourcing, as well as expanding the theoretical basis of traditional coopetition to include situations of forced coopetition.},

  abstract = {Although increased information systems (IS) development outsourcing is the trend, many of these arrangements fail to meet client expectations. We take a coordination perspective and adopt an information processing lens used by prior organization theorists to conceptualize sets of formal structural and informal nonstructural mechanisms, and predict their positive impacts on the strategic IT benefits achieved by the client. Utilizing a strategic alliance lens, we also predict that two characteristics of the client-vendor arrangement will moderate the impacts of both sets of coordination mechanisms. We test our hypotheses using hierarchical regression techniques on field survey data collected from 141 IS managers in client firms, responsible for IS development outsourcing arrangements. We found that the implementation of both structural and informal mechanisms positively impact the client’s strategic IT benefits. In arrangements with greater resource provisioning by the vendor, the positive impacts of informal governance mechanisms are strengthened. In arrangements with higher values similarity, the positive impacts of structural governance mechanisms are strengthened, but the positive impacts of informal mechanisms are weakened. A post-hoc analysis of a mediation model reveals that values similarity also has a positive relationship to both structural and informal governance mechanisms. This study therefore provides empirical support for the validity of an information processing lens to theorize lateral mechanism solutions to the coordination challenges of IS development outsourcing. Implications for research and practice are discussed, including the need for future research to better understand how client managers evolve sets of formal and informal mechanisms over the life of an outsourcing arrangement to achieve strategic objectives for their IT organization.},

  abstract = {Multisourcing, the practice of stitching together best-of-breed IT services from multiple, geographically dispersed service providers, represents the leading edge of modern organizational forms. While major strides have been achieved in the last decade in the information systems (IS) and strategic management literature in improving our understanding of outsourcing, the focus has been on a dyadic relationship between a client and a vendor. We demonstrate that a straightforward extrapolation of such a dyadic relationship falls short of addressing the nuanced incentive-effort-output linkages that arise when multiple vendors, who are competitors, have to cooperate and coordinate to achieve the client's business objectives. We suggest that when multiple vendors have to work together to deliver end-to-end services to a client, the choice of formal incentives and relational governance mechanisms depends on the degree of interdependence between the various tasks as well as the observability and verifiability of output. With respect to cooperation, we find that a vendor must not only put effort in a “primary” task it is responsible for but also cooperate through “helping” effort in enabling other vendors perform their primary tasks. In the context of coordination, we find that task redesign for modularity, OLAs, and governance structures such as the guardian vendor model represent important avenues for further research. Based on the analysis of actual multisourcing contract details over the last decade, interviews with leading practitioners, and a review of the single-sourcing literature, we lay a foundation for normative theories of multisourcing and present a research agenda in this domain.},

However, discussion is often the primary mode of coordination, and this can be problematic. Virtual collaborations absolutely need to mitigate these negative consequences of discussion-based coordination in order to thrive.},

Decentralization may bring flexibility and fast response to changing business needs, as well as other benefits, but decentralization also makes systems integration difficult, presents a barrier to standardization, and acts as a disincentive toward achieving economies of scale. As a result, there is a need to balance the decentralization of IT management to business units with some centralized planning for technology, data, and human resources. Here we explore three major mechanisms for facilitating interunitcoordination ofIT management:structural design approaches, functional coordination modes, and computer-based communication systems. We derme these various mechanisms and their interrelationships, and we discuss the relative costs and benefits associated with alternative coordination approaches. To illustrate the cost-benefit tradeoffs of coordination approaches, we present a case study in which computer-based communication systems were used to support team-based coordination of IT management across dispersed business units. Our analysis reveals possibilities for future approaches to IT coordination in large, dispersed organizations.},

It proposes to examine the key question: how can knowledge management problems and technology adoption difficulties be analysed through experts' practices embedded in their work contexts? The problems of knowledge transfer, coordination and reuse are investigated by examining experts' practices and work contexts. The inquiry is grounded in a qualitative case study of a knowledge management system designed to support maintenance work performed by two groups of engineers in a semiconductor-fabrication equipment company. The findings illustrate two contrasting outcomes: the equipment engineers found the system to be useful; the field engineers considered it to be irrelevant to their work contexts. An analysis of the fabrication process (the technical context), engineers' professional communities (the social context), and the pace of product/process innovation (the innovative context) helps us to understand the main problems underlying knowledge transfer, coordination and reuse. Significantly, we propose a specific definition of knowledge and suggest a way to examine practices and work contexts that can help to uncover new difficulties in knowledge management system adoption. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.},

However, current literature fails to acknowledge that, instead of being determined by one type of motivation, they are more likely to derive from the joint effect of both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation (i.e., rewards). Based on this, we expect extrinsic rewards to crowd out the effect of intrinsic motivation on knowledge sharing. We go further and contend that extrinsic rewards might provide a formal coordination mechanism and interact with an informal coordinating mechanism (i.e., the use lateral coordination to foster employees' knowledge sharing). We empirically test this argument on a sample of 754 employees. The analysis shows that knowledge-sharing rewards significantly hamper the positive effect of both intrinsic motivation and lateral integrative mechanisms on knowledge sharing, resulting in a detrimental factor for employees' social relationships and helpful behaviors.},

  abstract = {The continual advancement of internet technologies has led to the evolution of how individuals and organizations operate. For example, through the internet, we can now tap a remote workforce to help us accomplish certain tasks, a phenomenon called crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is an approach that relies on people to perform activities that are costly or time-consuming using traditional methods. Depending on the incentive given to the crowd workers, crowdsourcing can be classified as paid or unpaid. In paid crowdsourcing, the workers are incentivized financially, enabling the formation of a robust workforce, which allows fast completion of tasks. Consequently, in unpaid crowdsourcing, the lack of financial incentive potentially leads to an unpredictable workforce and indeterminable task completion time. However, since payment to workers is not necessary, it can be an economical alternative for individuals and organizations who are more concerned about the budget than the task turnaround time. In this study, we explore unpaid crowdsourcing by reviewing crowdsourcing applications where the crowd comes from a pool of volunteers. We also evaluate its performance in sentiment analysis and data extraction projects. Our findings suggest that for such tasks, unpaid crowdsourcing completes slower but yields results of similar or higher quality compared to its paid counterpart.},

Yet, in order to explore new applications for the crowdsourcing model, there must be a better understanding of why crowds participate in crowdsourcing processes. Based on 17 interviews conducted via instant messenger with members of the crowd at Threadless, the present study adds qualitatively rich data on a new crowdsourcing case to an existing body of quantitative data on motivations for participation in crowdsourcing. Four primary motivators for participation at Threadless emerge from these interview data: the opportunity to make money, the opportunity to develop one's creative skills, the potential to take up freelance work, and the love of community at Threadless. A fifth theme is also discussed that addresses the language of ‘addiction’ used by the interviewees to describe their activity on the site. Understanding this kind of ‘addiction’ in an online community is perhaps the most important finding for future public crowdsourcing ventures. This study develops a more complete – though ongoing – composite of what motivates the crowd to participate in crowdsourcing applications generally, information crucial to adapt the crowdsourcing model to new forms of problem-solving.},

  abstract = {The paradox of openness describes the fundamental tension between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection in open innovation. While sharing is vital for value creation, protecting is critical for value appropriation. Prior research has examined this paradox of openness from the perspective of the seeking firm, focusing on the firm-level challenges of inbound open innovation. In this article, we complement that research by illuminating the tensions between sharing and protecting in individual-level outbound open innovation, where we argue that the paradox of openness is most prevalent, yet much less well understood. Drawing on the experience of individual participants, or solvers, in intermediated crowdsourcing contests, we analyze textual data from 2,149 answers to five open-ended narrative questions embedded in a large-scale solver survey, as well as 43 in-depth interviews of solvers. Our findings indicate that individual solvers face fundamental sharing-protecting tensions that carry considerable economic and psychological costs. We also document how solvers attempt to navigate the paradox of openness by employing three formal and four informal value appropriation practices. They build elaborate configurations of these practices, which they tailor to the idiosyncrasies of each contest. They also dynamically adjust these configurations over time, as the contest and the interaction with the seeker unfold. We end by outlining how these findings contribute to a more multifaceted conceptualization and a richer understanding of the paradox of openness.},

  abstract = {Abstract Research Summary Digitalization has three fundamental characteristics, reprogrammability infrastructural elementality, and intangibility. Based on these characteristics, it is transforming how firms organize for value creation, delivery, and capture. Its intangibility and infrastructural character largely free economic and business activities from the constraints of physical geography like those imposed by transportation and collocation. Digital communication technologies typically reinforce the centrifugal forces that favor dispersing the firm's high knowledge activities. Digital in situ technologies strengthen the centripetal forces toward concentrating the firm's low knowledge activities. Location dependence and product modularity are crucial moderators for tangible products, while institutional barriers are important for intangible ones. Finally, digital technologies increase the resilience of firms during disruptive events that impose restrictions on the movements of people and goods, as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Managerial Summary Digitalization is a general purpose technology on the scale of the steam engine and electricity, and affects every aspect of business and society.

These logics capture the dominant ways of thinking in BPM, reflected in its assumptions, practices and values. While the three logics have proven useful in prior contexts, we argue that the applicability of these underlying assumptions in theorising BPM needs to be re-examined in the context of digital transformation. Based on an ethnographic study of BPM in a company undergoing digital transformation, we uncover tensions related to applying these prior logics that point to the need to upyear the underlying assumptions. Consequently, we propose new logics that we conceptualise as light touch processes (process), infrastructural flexibility (infrastructure) and mindful actors (agency). Our observations contribute to a rethinking of the dominant BPM logics by unpacking their dynamics in the context of digital transformation. Our study further highlight salient differences between digital transformation and IT-enabled organisational transformation contexts. We conclude by proposing new managerial approaches for BPM in digital transformation contexts.},

This paper provides a mixed review to determine the current state-of-the-art BIM development for sustainability. A systematic review approach was adopted to analyse two main sources of literature, namely, BIM standards and guidelines; and peer-reviewed academic publications. The result reveals that although there has been a significant amount of research and development about the use of BIM during various project phases, little work has been conducted about how it could be applied in refurbishment and demolition. Certain significant insights and implications have been uncovered, namely: (a) new BIM tools are required for assessing sustainability criteria; (b) the need for improved interoperability among BIM software and energy simulation tools; (c) BIM uses into various aspects of refurbishment and demolition have to be streamlined; and (d) an innovative procurement system is needed to adapt social sustainability into the project.},

  abstract = {Relational coordination suggests that high-quality relationships improve coordination. Yet as the landscape of work shifts toward digitization of coordination processes, organizations increasingly rely on digitally mediated structured coordination to accomplish work, reducing opportunities for personal interactions. In this article we explore the interplay between employees’ work relationships and differently structured coordination mechanisms to theorize about the role of relational coordination in coordination that is becoming increasingly structured owing to digitization. Specifically, we identify four categories of coordination mechanisms by leveraging two distinct components of a coordination mechanism—actor selection and content delivery—and recognizing that either component can be structured or unstructured. This granular categorization of coordination mechanisms allows us to delineate three causal routes by which relational coordination adds value to coordination enactment: informing actor selection, informing customization of content, and enabling shared interpretation. We complement prior research focusing on how, over time, coordination mechanisms influence the development of relational coordination by theorizing about how relational coordination enables the effective enactment of coordination mechanisms at a point in time. Our findings complement the understanding of the interplay between relational coordination and coordination mechanisms and can inform the design of coordination mechanisms in digitized work processes.},

Previous studies on the digital divide were unable to capture the detected trends appropriately, because they worked with proxies, such as the number of subscriptions or related investments, without considering the vast heterogeneity in informational performance among technological devices. We created a comprehensive data set (based on over 1,100 sources) that allows measuring information capacity directly, in bits per second, bits, and instructions per second. The newly proposed indicators provide insights into inequalities in access to, usage of, and impact of digitized information flows. It shows that the digital divide has gone into a second stage, which is based on a relative universalization of technological devices and a continuously evolving divide in terms of communication capacity.},

Yet the introduction of such systems has caused much concern about patients' information privacy. This study provides new insights into how privacy concerns play a role in patients' decisions to permit digitization of their personal health information. We conducted an online experiment and collected data from 164 patients who are involved in the nonmandatory EHR adoption in the Netherlands. We found that the negative effect of information privacy concerns on patients' willingness to opt in is influenced by the degree of EHR system interoperability and patients' ability to control disclosure of their information. The results show that, for a networked EHR system, the negative effect of privacy concerns on opt-in behavior was reinforced more than for the stand-alone system. The results also suggest that giving patients greater ability to control their information can alleviate their privacy concerns when they make opt-in decisions. We discuss the implications of these findings.},

Across domains, companies experience rapid changes to their existing practices due to new technologies and new entrants that current businesses. While digitalization brings endless opportunities, it comes with challenges that require companies to strategically engage with partners in their surrounding ecosystems. In this paper, we study how companies in the embedded systems domain experience the process of transitioning from product-based companies to businesses where software, data, and artificial intelligence (AI) play an increasingly important role. To manage this, these companies need to evolve their existing ecosystems while at the same time create new ecosystems around new technologies. This involves maintaining existing technologies such as mechanics and electronics while at the same time expanding these with software, data, and AI. We provide a strategic decision framework that helps software-intensive embedded systems companies to successfully navigate the digital transformation. We do this in two steps. First, we present three models that provide the technical content of the strategic decision framework. Second, we provide an overview of the strategic alternatives that incumbents and new entrants have available when existing technologies are commoditizing and new technologies are introduced.},

  abstract = {While small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly required to look for growth beyond their national markets, the increasing digitalization of the global economy provides them with ample opportunities for internationalization. However, many SMEs are unable to internationalize digitally because they were not initially designed to scale that way, and managing business model scaling in the online environment is challenging. In response to this, the current study applies a quantitative descriptive analysis of survey data on business adoption of digital technologies by 535 Canadian online-based SMEs. The aim is to understand, 1) how internationally-oriented online SMEs differ in terms of their digitalization from those focused on domestic markets, and 2) how these differences are related to the companies\\&rsquo; business model for scaling internationally. The results show that internationally-oriented online SMEs differ from their domestically-oriented peers, in terms of a higher degree in the 1) use of information systems, 2) extent of value networks, 3) emphasis on key internal resources, and, 4) dealing with cybersecurity issues. The study contributes to the literature by suggesting that online SMEs willing to scale internationally through digitalization need to develop a set of capabilities in regard to partnering, customer relationship, and business process management, as well as investing in information and communication (ICT) resources and cyber resilience.},

  abstract = {In this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. The layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. We posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. We develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.},

An alternative concept of information literacy and a broader definition of information literate people are introduced. The article suggests that librarians are currently bound by an educational concept of what information literacy is and how it manifests itself. They must begin to engage with and explore other contexts and practices that facilitate becoming information literate, in order to understand the role of information literacy in learning outside educational settings. By engaging with different contexts, concepts and truths, our provision of information literacy education will be enhanced and contribute towards learning practices which are transformative, generic and transferable.},

  abstract = {This conceptual and discursive paper argues that diversity is a recognizable source of creativity and innovation that can provide a basis for competitive advantage. On the other hand, diversity is also a cause of misunderstanding, suspicion and conflict in the workplace that can result in absenteeism, poor quality, low morale and loss of competitiveness. Firms seeking competitive advantage therefore face a paradoxical situation. If they embrace diversity, they risk workplace conflict, and if they avoid diversity, they risk loss of competitiveness. The advantages and disadvantages associated with workforce diversity put organizations in a position of managing a paradoxical situation. To give support to this assertion, the paper considers what is meant by diversity, how it is best managed, what its relationship with creativity and innovation might be and how the problems created by the management of diversity, creativity and innovation might be resolved.},

To reconcile these inconsistent past findings, the present study is designed to investigate the possible curvilinear relationship between organizational tenure diversity and team innovation, and the moderating effect of team-oriented HR practices. We collect data from 67 R\\&D teams, including 321 engineers, for our sample, and hierarchical regression analyses are conducted to test hypotheses. The results show that the curvilinear relationship does exist between organizational tenure diversity and team innovation, and this nonlinear relationship is moderated by team-oriented HR practices.},

There is a clear lack of representativeness when we observe gender distribution in Information Technology jobs and students in universities, for example. Diversity is good beyond ethic reasons, it's recognized as valuable and, lot of studies have been done about it. Large technology companies have been creating annual reports of their efforts to have a more diverse workforce, increasing minority numbers through recruiting, working to minimize unconscious bias and also investing in programs to increase representativeness. In this paper, we present a work in progress study that links a definition of diversity to the results of a survey applied to explore the perceptions of diversity in agile software development teams in Brazil and an initial analysis focusing mainly on the role of women in those teams.},

  abstract = {Diversity is being discussed intensively by different knowledge areas. Some studies show that diversity builds better teams, delivers better results, and more. Cognitive diversity is linked to better outcomes, and studies show that cognitive diversity is influenced by identity diversity (e.g., gender, race, age, etc.), mainly when tasks are related to problem-solving and prediction. The discussions about diversity in Software Engineering are increasing as well. There is a known lack of representativeness from some groups when we talk about identity diversity as, for example, gender and race. To support diversity in Software Engineering is valuable and it is especially relevant once we are dealing with problem-solving. In this work, we are interested in understanding how the subject is being conducted in Software Engineering-related research and more specifically, in Agile Methodologies. For that we conducted a Systematic Mapping, so we can have an overview of the research area through classification and counting contributions related to the subject. The outcome is an inventory of papers on how Diversity is being discussed in Software Engineering and Agile Methodologies. We list the most common publication venues, the frequency publication through the years, the main areas in software engineering that are interested in the subject and finally, a first discussion on how Agile Methodologies and their intrinsic characteristics can support better deliveries from more diverse development teams.},

  abstract = {Summary Existing results on the relationship between ethno-cultural diversity and innovation remain mixed. The authors argue that these inconsistencies were partly due to conceptual and empirical confusion regarding two aspects of ethno-cultural diversity. By conceptually and empirically teasing apart these two aspects of diversity, the authors demonstrated that diversity arising from ethnic categorization (referred to as ethnic diversity) impairs innovation, while diversity arising from cultural distance (referred to as cultural diversity) enhances innovation, but only when ethnic polarization is low. Consistent with the National Innovation System perspective, the present study using country-level data shows that structural innovation input positively contributes to innovation output. Furthermore, the authors found that ethnic diversity has a direct negative effect on innovation input, which in turn dampens innovation output. By contrast, cultural diversity has a direct positive effect on innovation output over and above the contribution of innovation input only when ethnic polarization is low.

Our study identifies a new facet of procedural utility and offers new insights about the motivations and goals of nascent entrepreneurs. Most importantly, we identify a group of nascent entrepreneurs that ‘cannot get satisfaction’ with their start-up—not because their start-up fails to deliver financial returns, but because they did not choose to become entrepreneurs in the first place. This group of unsatisfied entrepreneurs includes individuals starting a business after a period of long-term unemployment and those individuals with a lack of better employment alternatives (necessity entrepreneurs). In addition, we provide additional evidence for the importance of both financial and non-financial incentives of entrepreneurs. While financial success is the most important determinant of start-up satisfaction, achievement of independence and creativity is also highly important. Our results emphasize the relevance of procedural utility for understanding economic behavior. We show that the process leading to a decision has an impact on the later satisfaction with the outcome of that decision.},

This analytic distinction presents some limitations in explaining how coordination is reached in organizations characterized by distributed teams, scarce face to face meetings and fuzzy and changing lines of authority, as in free/libre open source software (FLOSS) development. Analyzing empirical illustrations from two FLOSS projects, we highlight the existence of a peculiar model, stigmergic coordination, which includes aspects of both implicit and explicit mechanisms. The work product itself (implicit) and the characteristics under which it is shared (explicit) play an under-appreciated role in helping software developers manage dependencies as they arise. We develop this argument beyond the existing literature by working with an existing coordination framework, considering the role that the codebase itself might play at each step. We also discuss the features and the practices to support stigmergic coordination in distributed teams, as well as recommendations for future research.},

  abstract = {To manage work interdependencies, online communities draw on a variety of arm’s length coordination mechanisms offered by information technology platforms and associated practices. However, “unresolved interdependencies” remain that cannot be addressed by such arm’s length mechanisms. These interdependencies reflect, for example, unidentified or emerging knowledge-based dependencies between the community members or unaccounted relationships between ongoing community tasks. At the same time, online communities cannot resort to hierarchical coordination mechanisms such as incentives or command structures to address such interdependencies. So, how do they manage such interdependencies? To address this question, we conduct an exploratory, theory-generating case study involving qualitative and computational analyses of development activities within an open source software community: Rubinius. We analyze the ongoing management of interdependencies within the community and find that unresolved interdependencies are associated with alternatively structured sequences of activities, which we define as routines. In particular, we observe that two distinct classes of interdependencies—development and developer interdependencies—are associated with alternative forms of routine variation. We identify two generalized routine components—direct implementation and knowledge integration, which address these two distinct classes of unresolved interdependencies. In particular, direct implementation deals with development interdependencies within the code that are not already coordinated through modular interfaces, while knowledge integration resolves unaccounted interdependencies between developers. We conclude with implications for research into organizing principles for online communities and note the significance of our findings for the study of coordination in organization studies in general.},

  abstract = {Governance provides the authoritative framework for coordinating activities in open source development. Prior studies of open source governance have largely focused on its changing nature over time. In this work, we argue that the nature of governance varies across open source communities, and, in its evolution, multiple traces of authority may co-exist. We propose that such multiplicity can be understood by close examination of the authoritative structures embedded in coordination processes. We collected eight years of data on the coordination related to version control of the Linux kernel. Drawing on in-depth qualitative analysis, we investigate how coordination processes with different authoritative structures come together in the governance of open source software. We trace four coordination processes (autocratic clearing, oligarchic recursion, federated self-governance, and meritocratic idea-testing), each grounded in different authoritative structures (autocracy, oligarchy, federation, meritocracy) with their own form of legitimation. We offer a two-fold contribution in this paper. First, we enhance the open source governance literature by advancing a new theoretical perspective in which governance is seen as a configuration of coordination processes. Configurations give complementary support and are a source of tension and renewal. Second, we articulate a view on the conceptual relationship between governance and coordination where these concepts are understood as a duality, both working together to give rise to efficient and dynamic organizing in open source.},

  abstract = {Background: As the area of computing has thrived over the years, the participation of women in computing declined. Currently women represent less than 24\% of the computing workforce and that number is declining. On the other hand, the ratios of women in Open Source Software (OSS) projects are even lower.Aims: The primary objective of this study is to determine the level of gender diversity among popular OSS projects and identify the presence of gender biases that may discourage females' participation.Method: On this goal, we mined the code review repositories of ten popular OSS projects. We used a semi-automated approach followed by a manual validation to identify the genders of the active contributors.Results: Our results suggest that lack of gender diversity remains an ongoing issue among all the ten projects as each of the projects had less than 10\% female developers. However, many of the projects also suffer from lack of inclusion of females to leadership positions. Although none of the projects suggest significant differences between male and female developers in terms of productivity based on three different measures, data from three out of the ten projects indicate technical biases against female developers with lower code acceptance rates as well as delayed feedback during code reviews. However, biases against females are not universal as majority of the projects do not discriminate against females. The two projects with the least ratios of female contributors as core developers showed the most biases against females.Conclusion: Based on our findings, we conclude that promoting and mentoring females to leadership positions may be an effective solution to foster gender diversity.},

The primary goal of this study is to identify the differences in expressions of sentiments between male and female developers during various software engineering tasks.

We also compute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by each developer. Our results suggest that the likelihood of using sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on the gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express sentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their male colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the six projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also withholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Our results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative work place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.},

All open source licenses grant the right to fork their code, that is to start a new development effort using an existing code as its base. Thus, code forking represents the single greatest tool available for guaranteeing sustainability in open source software. In addition to bolstering program sustainability, code forking directly affects the governance of open source initiatives. Forking, and even the mere possibility of forking code, affects the governance and sustainability of open source initiatives on three distinct levels: software, community, and ecosystem. On the software level, the right to fork makes planned obsolescence, versioning, vendor lock-in, end-of-support issues, and similar initiatives all but impossible to implement. On the community level, forking impacts both sustainability and governance through the power it grants the community to safeguard against unfavourable actions by corporations or project leaders. On the business-ecosystem level forking can serve as a catalyst for innovation while simultaneously promoting better quality software through natural selection. Thus, forking helps keep open source initiatives relevant and presents opportunities for the development and commercialization of current and abandoned programs.},

In such a setting, open source software offers excellent opportunities for sustainability.

The most powerful of these mechanisms is the ability to fork the project. In this paper we argue that the possibility to fork serves as the invisible hand of sustainability that ensures that code remains open and that the code that best serves the community lives on. Furthermore, the mere option to fork provides a mechanism for safeguarding against despotic decisions by the project lead, who is thus guided in their actions to consider the best interest of the community.},

However, in some cases different groups of developers make the software evolve in different directions, a situation which is commonly known as a fork. In the case of free software, although forking is a practice that is considered as a last resort, it is inherent to the four freedoms. This paper tries to shed some light on the practice of forking. Therefore, we have identified significant forks, several hundreds in total, and have studied them in depth. Among the issues that have been analyzed for each fork is the year when the forking occurred, the reason of the fork, and the outcome of the fork, i.e., if the original or the forking project are still developed. Our investigation shows, among other results, that forks occur in every software domain, that they have become more frequent in recent years, and that very few forks merge with the original project.},

This paper inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two software communities with different governance structures. In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code. Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine the advantages of open source software development with proprietary ownership and control are discussed.},

In addition to increasing software quality, there is anecdotal evidence that peer code review has other benefits, including: sharing knowledge, sharing expertise, sharing development techniques, and most importantly building accurate peer impressions between the code review participants. To further investigate the presence of these benefits, we surveyed members of popular OSS communities who were involved with peer code review. We used established scales from Psychology, Information science, and Organizational Behavior to create survey questions. We also enforced multiple reliability and validity measures to ensure higher confidence in the survey results. In this paper, we present a subset of the surveys results focused on better understanding four aspects of peer impression formation: trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship. The results indicate that there is indeed a high level of trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship between OSS peers who have participated in code review for a period of time. Because code review involves examining someone else's code, unsurprisingly, peer code review helped most in building a perception of expertise between code review partners.},

Thus a large body of OSS studies focuses on studying the developers' participation motivations. One important motivation is an OSS developer's desire to gain good community reputation which is largely based on positive evaluations from his peers. Therefore, to better motivate developers' project participations through their reputation needs, our empirical analysis adopted a social network perspective to study what factors may affect a developer's decision to positively evaluate one other in a large online open source community called Ohloh. The results surprisingly show that a developer's positive evaluation decision does not depend on his evaluatee's level of OSS-related experience, but rather based on 1) his past reputation (i.e. existing number of positive evaluations), 2) their shared affiliations such as mutual acquaintances, as well as 3) their homophily in location (city), nationality, programming language preference, and community status. We then discuss these findings and their implications for inducing more positive evaluations and better reputation management among open source project members. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research that investigates issues of reputation building and relationship management in an open source development context.},

  abstract = {As most of the software development organizations are male-dominated, many female developers encounter negative workplace experiences and report feeling like they “do not belong”. Exposures to discriminatory expletives or negative critiques from their male colleagues may further exacerbate those feelings. The primary goal of this study is to identify the differences in expressions of sentiments between male and female developers during various software engineering tasks. On this goal, we mined the code review repositories of six popular open source projects. We used a semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as multiple social networks to identify the gender of a developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering domain, we classify each communication as negative, positive, or neutral. We also compute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by each developer. Our results suggest that the likelihood of using sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on the gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express sentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their male colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the six projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also withholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Our results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative work place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.},

However, integrating external and internal sources of social capital is challenging and identifying appropriate integration strategies is crucial for the success of such endeavors. This study examines the simultaneous effects of external and internal sources of social capital, in the form of participant and project differences, and examines how they interact to influence OSS project success. We propose a taxonomy of participant differences (language, role, and contribution) and project differences (development environment and connectedness) and postulate their main and moderating effects on project success. Using a four-year panel data set of 329 SourceForge projects, we show that development environment difference has a curvilinear relationship with success and that connectedness reduces the positive impact of role and contribution diversity on project success. We also show that when development environment difference is moderate, the impact of role diversity is the most positive. We present the implications of these findings for theory and practice.},

To better understand the workings of open source environments, we examine the effects of network embeddedness—or the nature of the relationship among projects and developers—on the success of open source projects. We find that considerable heterogeneity exists in the network embeddedness of open source projects and project managers. We use a visual representation of the affiliation network of projects and developers as well as a formal statistical analysis to demonstrate this heterogeneity and to investigate how these structures differ across projects and project managers. Our main results surround the effect of this differential network embeddedness on project success. We find that network embeddedness has strong and significant effects on both technical and commercial success, but that those effects are quite complex. We use latent class regression analysis to show that multiple regimes exist and that some of the effects of network embeddedness are positive under some regimes and negative under others. We use project age and number of page views to provide insights into the direction of the effect of network embeddedness on project success. Our findings show that different aspects of network embeddedness have powerful but subtle effects on project success and suggest that this is a rich environment for further study.},

Motivated by this phenomenon, this research investigates how these teams are formed and how individuals make decisions about which teams to join in the context of open source software development (OSSD). The focus of this paper is to explore how the collaborative network affects developers' choice of newly initiated OSS projects to participate in. More specifically, by analyzing software project data from real-world OSSD projects, we empirically test the impact of past collaborative ties with and perceived status of project members in the network on the self-assembly of OSSD teams. Overall, we find that a developer is more likely to join a project when he has strong collaborative ties with its initiator. We also find that perceived status of the noninitiator members of a project influences its probability of attracting developers. We discuss the implications of our results with respect to self-organizing teams and OSSD.},

We found that nearly half of the research investigates the structure of developer communities. Other frequent topics are prediction systems build using DSNs, collaboration behavior between developers, and the roles of developers. Moreover, we determined that many publications use a small sample size regarding the number of projects, which could be problematic for the external validity of the research.

  abstract = {Open Source Software projects are communities in which people ``learn the ropes'' from each other. The social and technical activities of developers evolve together, and as they link to each other they get organized in a network of changing socio-technical connections. Traces of those activities, or behaviors, are typically visible to all, in project repositories and through communication between them. Thus, in principle it may be possible to study those traces to tell which of the observable socio-technical behaviors of developers in these projects are responsible for the forming of persistent links between them. It may also be possible to tell the extent to which links participate in the spread of potential behavioral influences. Since OSS projects change in both social and technical activity over time, static approaches, that either ignore time or simplify it to a few slices, are frequently inadequate to study these networks. On the other hand, ad-hoc dynamic approaches are often only loosely supported by theory and can yield misleading findings. Here we adapt the stochastic actor-oriented models from social network analysis. These models enable the study of the interplay between behavior, influence and network architecture, for dynamic networks, in a statistically sound way. We apply the stochastic actor-oriented models in case studies of two Apache Software Foundation projects, and study code ownership and developer productivity as behaviors. For those, we find evidence of significant social selection effects (homophily) in both projects, but in different directions. However, we find no evidence for the spread (social influence) of either code ownership or developer productivity behaviors through the networks.},

We adopt a fine-grained view of network relations to investigate the impact of network ties on the success of OSS development. Through examining the development of OSS projects hosted by SourceForge, we find that co-membership among project teams is an effective mechanism for building network ties, through which knowledge and expertise flows across projects in OSS community and, therefore, contributes to the success of OSS development. However, network ties among projects not only confer benefit, but also incur various cost, and due to the different growth patterns of cost and benefit, network ties have a diminishing return to project success. In addition, we find network ties of leader–follower type and follower–leader type are more beneficial to OSS success than other types of ties, and network ties connecting to projects of later development stages are more beneficial than those connecting to projects of earlier stages. Our study provides useful guidelines and suggestions as to how to leverage the knowledge and expertise of others for successful development of OSS projects.},

  abstract = {Established open source software (OSS) projects can grow in size if new developers join, but also the number of OSS projects can grow if developers choose to found new projects. We discuss to what extent an established model for firm growth can be applied to the dynamics of OSS projects. Our analysis is based on a large-scale data set from SourceForge (SF) consisting of monthly data for 10 years, for up to 360,000 OSS projects and up to 340,000 developers. Over this time period, we find an exponential growth both in the number of projects and developers, with a remarkable increase of single-developer projects after 2009. We analyze the monthly entry and exit rates for both projects and developers, the growth rate of established projects and the monthly project size distribution. To derive a prediction for the latter, we use modeling assumptions of how newly entering developers choose to either found a new project or to join existing ones. Our model applies only to collaborative projects that are deemed to grow in size by attracting new developers. We verify, by a thorough statistical analysis, that the Yule–Simon distribution is a valid candiyear for the size distribution of collaborative projects except for certain time periods where the modeling assumptions no longer hold. We detect and empirically test the reason for this limitation, i.e., the fact that an increasing number of established developers found additional new projects after 2009.},

We adapt and extend the heterogeneous diffusion model from sociology and examine the conditions under which prior adopters of competing open source software (OSS) licenses socially influence how a new OSS project chooses among such licenses and how the experiences of the project manager of a new OSS project with particular licenses affects its susceptibility to this social influence. We test our predictions using a sample of 5,307 open source projects hosted at SourceForge. Our results suggest the most important factor determining a new project's license choice is the type of license chosen by existing projects that are socially closer to it in its inter-project social network. Moreover, we find that prior adopters of a particular license are more infectious in their influence on the license choice of a new project as their size and performance rankings increase. We also find that managers of new projects who have been members of more successful prior OSS projects and who have greater depth and diversity of experience in the OSS community are less susceptible to social influence. Finally, we find a project manager is more likely to adopt a particular license type when his or her project occupies a similar social role as other projects that have adopted the same license. These results have implications for research on innovation adoption and diffusion, open source software licensing, and the governance of economic exchange.},

Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a longitudinal panel of2,3 78 projects hosted at SourceForge. We find that network social capital is not equally accessible to or appropriated by all projects. Our main results are as follows.First, projects with greater internal cohesion (that is, cohesion among the project members) are more successful. Second, external cohesion (that is, cohesion among the external contacts of a project) has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the project's success; moderate levels of external cohesion are best for a project's success rather than very low or very high levels. Third, the technological diversity of the external network of a project also has the greatest benefit when it is neither too low nor too high. Fourth, the number of direct and indirect external contacts positively affects a project's success such that the effect of the number of direct contacts is moderated by the number of indirect contacts. These results are robust to several control variables and alternate model specifications. Several theoretical and managerial implications are provided.},

  abstract = {Two property regimes for software development may be distinguished. Within corporations, on the one hand, a Private Regime obtains which excludes all outsiders from access to a firm's software assets. It is shown how the protective instruments of secrecy and both copyright and patent have been strengthened considerably during the last two decades. On the other, a Public Regime among hackers may be distinguished, initiated by individuals, organizations or firms, in which source code is freely exchanged. It is argued that copyright is put to novel use here: claiming their rights, authors write ‘open source licenses’ that allow public usage of the code, while at the same time regulating the inclusion of users. A ‘regulated commons’ is created. The analysis focuses successively on the most important open source licenses to emerge, the problem of possible incompatibility between them (especially as far as the dominant General Public License is concerned), and the fragmentation into several user communities that may result.},

It seeks to provide a background overview of research in this area through a review of selected empirical studies of F/OSSD processes. The results and findings from a survey of empirical studies of F/OSSD give rise to an interesting variety of opportunities and challenges for understanding these processes, which are identified along the way. Overall, what becomes clear is that studies of F/OSSD processes reveal a more diverse set of different types of processes than have typically been examined in conventional software development projects. The articles in this special issue further advance understanding of what processes characterize and shape F/OSSD. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The objective of this paper is to pause and reflect on the state of the field. We start by conducting a comprehensive literature review of open source research, and organize the resulting 618 peer-reviewed articles into a taxonomy. Elements of this taxonomy are defined and described. We then draw on a number of existing categorization schemes to develop a framework to situate open source research within a wider nomological network. Building on concepts from systems theory, we propose a holistic framework of open source research. This framework incorporates current research, as represented by the taxonomy, identifies gaps and areas of overlap, and charts a path for future work. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) has attracted enormous media and research attention since the term was coined in February 1998. The concept itself is founded on the paradoxical premise that software source code-the 'crown jewels' for many proprietary software companies-should be provided freely to anyone who wishes to see it. Given this fundamental initial paradox, it is perhaps hardly surprising that the OSS concept is characterised by contradictions, paradoxes and tensions throughout. In this paper we focus specifically on the following issues in relation to OSS: the cathedral v. bazaar development approach; collectivism v. individualism, the bitter strife within the OSS community itself (OSS v. OSS), and between OSS and the Free Software Foundation (OSS v. FSF); whether OSS represents a paradigm shift in the software industry; whether the software is truly open-the Berkeley Conundrum, as we have termed it here; whether OSS truly is high quality software; and whether OSS is a 'one size fits all,' representing the future model for all software development.},

  abstract = {A frequent characterization of open source software is the somewhat outyeard, mythical one of a collective of supremely talented software hackers freely volunteering their services to produce uniformly high-quality software. I contend that the open source software phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss how the bazaar metaphor, which up to now has been associated with the open source development process, has actually shifted to become a metaphor better suited to the OSS 2.0 product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental alteration of the basic ground rules in the software landscape, signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to address key challenges for research and practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract Since the turn of the century, open source software has triggered a vast volume of research. In this essay, based on a brief review of selected work, we show that research in many different fields and disciplines of the social sciences have shed light on the phenomenon. We argue that five characteristics make the phenomenon particularly attractive to examination from various fields and disciplines using a plethora of research methods: (1) impact: open source software has an extensive impact on the economy and society; (2) theoretical tension: the phenomenon deviates sharply from the predictions and explanations of existing theory in different fields; (3) transparency: open source software has offered researchers an unprecedented access to data; (4) communal reflexivity: the community of open source software developers frequently engage in a dialog on its functioning (it also has its own research community); (5) proximity: the innovation process in open source software resembles knowledge production in science (in many instances, open source software is an output of research processes). These five characteristics also promote a transdisciplinary research dialog. Based on the experience of open source software research, we propose that phenomena-driven transdisciplinary research provides an excellent context to promote greater dialog between disciplines and fields. Moreover, we propose that the recent diffusion of the open source software model of innovation to other areas than software calls for new research and that the field of information systems has an important role to play in this future research agenda.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy-opensourcing, as we term it here-whereby commerical companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company. Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.},

The search was first carried out in May 2009 and then once again in May 2010. In 2009, 237 articles were first found, from which 19 were selected based on content and quality, and in 2010, 76 new articles were found from which four were selected. Twenty three articles were identified in total. The articles could be divided into four categories: open source as part of component based software engineering, business models with open source in commercial organization, company participation in open source development communities, and usage of open source processes within a company.},

This chapter tells the story of how the FLOSSmole project began, where the data comes from and what we have learned from it, and how the project has grown and changed over the years. In addition to capturing snapshots of the current state of the FLOSS landscape, FLOSSmole also serves as a mirror to the larger FLOSS ecosystem, since changes in FLOSSmole's mission and goals over the years necessarily reflect some of the cultural and technological changes taking place in FLOSS itself. As such, FLOSSmole will continue to face many challenges in the future, including the continual need to provide broader access and more sophisticated and relevant data and analyses and to do all this in a way that is sustainable and community driven.},

Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of ``openness'', we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of ``openness'' characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy. The framework further distinguishes open resources, open processes and the effects of opening on particular domains. To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT). We conclude by highlighting some concerns with and limitations of ``openness''.},

  abstract = {Currently, two models of innovation are prevalent in organization science. The “private investment” model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection. The “collective action” model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound “private-collective” model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the “best of both worlds” under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for scholars in organization science. We offer some details regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source software development processes.},

The paper is based on three sectorial and generic cases of open source innovation, which is an offspring of contemporary theory made possible by combining elements of the model of private agency with those of the model of collective agency.

  abstract = {Open innovation is a powerful framework encompassing the generation, capture, and employment of intellectual property at the firm level. We identify three fundamental challenges for firms in applying the concept of open innovation: finding creative ways to exploit internal innovation, incorporating external innovation into internal development, and motivating outsiders to supply an ongoing stream of external innovations. This latter challenge involves a paradox, why would firms spend money on R\&D efforts if the results of these efforts are available to rival firms? To explore these challenges, we examine the activity of firms in open-source software to support their innovation strategies. Firms involved in open-source software often make investments that will be shared with real and potential rivals. We identify four strategies firms employ – pooled R\&D/product development, spinouts, selling complements and attracting donated complements – and discuss how they address the three key challenges of open innovation. We conclude with suggestions for how similar strategies may apply in other industries and offer some possible avenues for future research on open innovation.},

In this article, we reconsider what success means within a FLOSS context. We first review existing models of IS success and success variables used in FLOSS research and assess them for their usefulness, practicality and fit to the FLOSS context. Then, drawing on a theoretical model of group effectiveness in the FLOSS development process, as well as an on-line discussion with developers, we present additional concepts that are central to an appropriate understanding of success for FLOSS.In order to examine the practicality and validity of this conceptual scheme, the second half of our article presents an empirical study that demonstrates operationalizations of the chosen measures and assesses their internal validity. We use data from SourceForge to measure the project's effectiveness in team building, the speed of the project at responding to bug reports and the project's popularity. We conclude by discussing the implications of this study for our proposed extension of IS success in the context of FLOSS development and highlight future directions for research.

Following a case study methodology, we examined developer interaction data from three active and successful FLOSS projects using qualitative research methods, specifically inductive content analysis, to identify the task-assignment mechanisms used by the participants. We found that ‘self-assignment’ was the most common mechanism across three FLOSS projects. This mechanism is consistent with expectations for distributed and largely volunteer teams. We conclude by discussing whether these emergent practices can be usefully transferred to mainstream practice and indicating directions for future research.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom about distributed teams, FLOSS developers generally do not meet face-to-face until the project is well under way.

  abstract = {Peer production phenomena such as open source software (OSS) have been posited as a viable alternative to traditional production models. However, community-based development often falls short of creating software “products” in the sense that consumers understand. Our research identifies an emerging business network archetype in the OSS sector, the open source service network (OSSN), which seeks to address the “productization” challenge. To do so, OSSNs must overcome the problems associated with exchanging resources between firms. We demonstrate that OSSNs overcome exchange problems by primarily relying on social, rather than legal, mechanisms; similar to the OSS communities from which they emerged. This is made possible because OSSNs use IT infrastructures that provide high visibility for primary value-creating activities. The research utilizes a multimethod theory-building approach, deriving a model from extant research, refining the model through qualitative case study analysis, and further refining the model through quantitative analysis of survey data. The paper reveals the manifestation of social mechanisms in OSSNs and how these are used for coordinating and safeguarding exchanges between firms. Specifically, we illustrate the primary importance of a shared macroculture (goals and norms) and collective sanctions for punishing firms who violate these goals/norms. Furthermore, our research highlights the interplay between digital and social networks within OSSNs, demonstrating that the use of social mechanisms is inherently dependent upon the underlying IT infrastructure.},

  abstract = {The emerging work on understanding open source software has questioned what leads to effectiveness in OSS development teams in the absence of formal controls, and it has pointed to the importance of ideology. This paper develops a framework of the OSS community ideology (including specific norms, beliefs, and values) and a theoretical model to show how adherence to components of the ideology impacts effectiveness in OSS teams. The model is based on the idea that the tenets of the OSS ideology motivate behaviors that enhance cognitive trust and communication quality and encourage identification with the project team, which enhances affective trust. Trust and communication in turn impact OSS team effectiveness. The research considers two kinds of effectiveness in OSS teams: the attraction and retention of developer input and the generation of project outputs. Hypotheses regarding antecedents to each are developed. Hypotheses are tested using survey and objective data on OSS projects. Results support the main thesis that OSS team members' adherence to the tenets of the OSS community ideology impacts OSS team effectiveness and reveal that different components impact effectiveness in different ways. Of particular interest is the finding that adherence to some ideological components was beneficial to the effectiveness of the team in terms of attracting and retaining input, but detrimental to the output of the team. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

We define network social capital as the benefits open source developers secure from their membership in developer collaboration networks. We focus on one specific type of success as measured by the rate of knowledge creation in an open source project. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a longitudinal panel of2,3 78 projects hosted at SourceForge. We find that network social capital is not equally accessible to or appropriated by all projects. Our main results are as follows.First, projects with greater internal cohesion (that is, cohesion among the project members) are more successful. Second, external cohesion (that is, cohesion among the external contacts of a project) has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the project's success; moderate levels of external cohesion are best for a project's success rather than very low or very high levels. Third, the technological diversity of the external network of a project also has the greatest benefit when it is neither too low nor too high. Fourth, the number of direct and indirect external contacts positively affects a project's success such that the effect of the number of direct contacts is moderated by the number of indirect contacts. These results are robust to several control variables and alternate model specifications. Several theoretical and managerial implications are provided.},

  abstract = {The increasing popularity and use of Open Source Software (OSS) has led to significant interest from research communities and enterprise practitioners, notably in the small business sector where this type of software offers particular benefits given the financial and human capital constraints faced. However, there has been little focus on developing valid frameworks that enable critical evaluation and common understanding of factors influencing OSS adoption. This paper seeks to address this shortcoming by presenting a theory-grounded framework for exploring these factors and explaining their influence on OSS adoption, with the context of study being small- to medium-sized Information Technology (IT) businesses in the U.K. The framework has implications for this type of business -- and, we will suggest, more widely -- as a frame of reference for understanding, and as tool for evaluating benefits and challenges in, OSS adoption. It also offers researchers a structured way of investigating adoption issues and a base from which to develop models of OSS adoption. The study reported in this paper used the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (DTPB) as a basis for the research propositions, with the aim of: (i) developing a framework of empirical factors that influence OSS adoption; and (ii) appraising it through case study evaluation with 10 U.K. Small- to medium-sized enterprises in the IT sector. The demonstration of the capabilities of the framework suggests that it is able to provide a reliable explanation of the complex and subjective factors that influence attitudes, subjective norms and control over the use of OSS. The paper further argues that the DTPB proved useful in this research area and that it can provide a variety of situation-specific insights related to factors that influence the adoption of OSS.},

We first analyze the general structure of the social networks, e.g., graph distances and the degree distribution of the social networks. Our analysis confirms that the social networks of OSS communities follow power-law degree distributions and exhibit small-world characteristics. However, the degree mixing pattern shows that high degree nodes tend to connect more with low degree nodes, suggesting collaborations between experts and newbie developers. Second, we study the correlation between graph degrees and the productivity of the contributors in terms of the amount of contribution and commitment to OSS projects.

The well-being of a FOSS project depends on the turning of project newcomers into ‘good contributors’ that is to say into individuals that substantially contribute to the project - but also that perform citizenship behaviors that protect and nurture its community. This study is a mixed-methods investigation of the socialization factors that influence contributor performance in large FOSS projects. A qualitative research component resulted into the development of a FOSS socialization framework as well as into the identification of key FOSS project citizenship behaviors. A conceptual model was then developed and empirically examined with 367 contributors from 12 large FOSS projects. The model hypothesizes the mediating effect of two proximal socialization variables, social identification and social integration, between FOSS newcomer socialization factors and contributor performance (conceptualized as task performance and community citizenship behaviors). The results demonstrate the influence of social identification and social integration in predicting contributor performance, as well as the importance of key socialization factors that are: task segregation, task purposefulness, interaction intensity, and supportiveness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Metaphors, such as the Cathedral and Bazaar, used to describe the organization of FLOSS projects typically place them in sharp contrast to proprietary development by emphasizing FLOSS’s distinctive social and communications structures. But what do we really know about the communication patterns of FLOSS projects? How generalizable are the projects that have been studied? Is there consistency across FLOSS projects? Questioning the assumption of distinctiveness is important because practitioner–advocates from within the FLOSS community rely on features of social structure to describe and account for some of the advantages of FLOSS production. To address this question, we examined 120 project teams from SourceForge, representing a wide range of FLOSS project types, for their communications centralization as revealed in the interactions in the bug tracking system. We found that FLOSS development teams vary widely in their communications centralization, from projects completely centered on one developer to projects that are highly decentralized and exhibit a distributed pattern of conversation between developers and active users. We suggest, therefore, that it is wrong to assume that FLOSS projects are distinguished by a particular social structure merely because they are FLOSS. Our findings suggest that FLOSS projects might have to work hard to achieve the expected development advantages which have been assumed to flow from g̈oing open.Ïn addition, the variation in communications structure across projects means that communications centralization is useful for comparisons between FLOSS teams. We found that larger FLOSS teams tend to have more decentralized communication patterns, a finding that suggests interesting avenues for further research examining, for example, the relationship between communications structure and code modularity.},

  abstract = {The community-based model for software development in open source environments is becoming a viable alternative to traditional firm-based models. To better understand the workings of open source environments, we examine the effects of network embeddedness—or the nature of the relationship among projects and developers—on the success of open source projects. We find that considerable heterogeneity exists in the network embeddedness of open source projects and project managers. We use a visual representation of the affiliation network of projects and developers as well as a formal statistical analysis to demonstrate this heterogeneity and to investigate how these structures differ across projects and project managers. Our main results surround the effect of this differential network embeddedness on project success. We find that network embeddedness has strong and significant effects on both technical and commercial success, but that those effects are quite complex. We use latent class regression analysis to show that multiple regimes exist and that some of the effects of network embeddedness are positive under some regimes and negative under others. We use project age and number of page views to provide insights into the direction of the effect of network embeddedness on project success. Our findings show that different aspects of network embeddedness have powerful but subtle effects on project success and suggest that this is a rich environment for further study.},

  abstract = {Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development teams provide an interesting and convenient setting for studying distributed work. We begin by answering perhaps the most basic question: what is the social structure of these teams? We conducted social network analyses of bug-fixing interactions from three repositories: Sourceforge, GNU Savannah and Apache Bugzilla. We find that some OSS teams are highly centralized, but contrary to expectation, others are not. Projects are mostly quite hierarchical on four measures of hierarchy, consistent with past research but contrary to the naive image of these projects. Furthermore, we find that the level of centralization is negatively correlated with project size, suggesting that larger projects become more modular, or possibly that becoming more modular is a key to growth. The paper makes a further methodological contribution by identifying appropriate analysis approaches for interaction data. We conclude by sketching directions for future research.},

With the help of our tool and method called TESNA, we demonstrate a method to monitor the socio-technical core-periphery movement in Open Source projects. We then study the impact of different core-periphery movements on Open Source projects. We conclude that a steady core-periphery shift towards the core is beneficial to the project, whereas shifts away from the core are clearly not good. Furthermore, oscillatory shifts towards and away from the core can be considered as an indication of the instability of the project. Such an analysis can provide developers with a good insight into the health of an Open Source project. Researchers can gain from the pattern theory, and from the method we use to study the core-periphery movements.},

  abstract = {Two-mode networks are used to describe dual patterns of association between distinct social entities through their joint involvement in categories, activities, issues, and events. In empirical organizational research, the analysis of two-mode networks is typically accomplished either by (a) decomposition of the dual structure into its two unimodal components defined in terms of indirect relations between entities of the same kind or (b) direct statistical analysis of individual two-mode dyads. Both strategies are useful, but neither is fully satisfactory. In this article, the authors introduce newly developed stochastic actor-based models for two-mode networks that may be adopted to redress the limitations of current analytical strategies. The authors specify and estimate the model in the context of data they have collected on the dual association between software developers and software problems observed during a complete release cycle of an open source software project. The authors discuss the general methodological implications of the models for organizational research based on the empirical analysis of two-mode networks.},

Yet relational event data are typically aggregated and dichotomized to derive networks that can be analyzed with specialized statistical methods. Transforming sequences of relational events into binary network ties entails two main limitations: the loss of information about the order and number of events that compose each tie and the inability to account for compositional changes in the set of actors and/or recipients. In this article, we introduce a newly developed class of statistical models that enables researchers to exploit the full information contained in sequences of relational events. We propose an extension of the models to cater for sequences of relational events linking different sets of actors. We illustrate the empirical application of relational event models in the context of a free/open source software project with the aim to explain the level of effort produced by contributors to the project. We offer guidance in the interpretation of model parameters by characterizing the social processes underlying organizational problem solving. We discuss the applicability of relational events models in organizational research.},

We consider individual problem solving attempts as acts of production embedded in an evolving bipartite network which affiliates organizational participants to organizational problems. We document how local configurations of network ties (or motifs) linking participants to problems emerge from – but at the same time sustain decentralized problem solving activities. Structural characteristics of the observed network suggest specific dependence hypotheses linking participants to problems. We explore these hypotheses by examining problem solving attempts performed by 135 participants in an open source software project on the 719 problems (software bugs) recorded during a complete release cycle of the software. Our empirical strategy relies on the specification and estimation of newly derived stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) originally conceived for the analysis of social networks. We find that individual problem solving behavior is activated by the interaction between local configurations of network ties, the level of experience of problem solvers, and the level of difficulty of problems. The discussion focuses on the broad theoretical implications of the study for the relation between work practices and organizational structures.},

Building upon Lave and Wenger's theory of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP), this paper offers a longitudinal investigation of one OSS community in which sustained participation is hypothesized to be associated with the coevolution of two major elements of LPP theory: "situated learning" (the process of acting knowledgeably and purposefully in the world) and "identity construction" (the process of being identified within the community). To test this hypothesis, data were collected from multiple sources, including online public project documents, electronic mail messages, tracker messages, and log files. Results from qualitative analyses revealed that initial conditions to participate did not effectively predict long-term participation, but that situated learning and identity construction behaviors were positively linked to sustained participation. Furthermore, this study reveals that sustained participants distinguished themselves by consistently engaging in situated learning that both made conceptual (advising others) and practical contributions (improving the code).

  abstract = {To manage work interdependencies, online communities draw on a variety of arm’s length coordination mechanisms offered by information technology platforms and associated practices. However, “unresolved interdependencies” remain that cannot be addressed by such arm’s length mechanisms. These interdependencies reflect, for example, unidentified or emerging knowledge-based dependencies between the community members or unaccounted relationships between ongoing community tasks. At the same time, online communities cannot resort to hierarchical coordination mechanisms such as incentives or command structures to address such interdependencies. So, how do they manage such interdependencies? To address this question, we conduct an exploratory, theory-generating case study involving qualitative and computational analyses of development activities within an open source software community: Rubinius. We analyze the ongoing management of interdependencies within the community and find that unresolved interdependencies are associated with alternatively structured sequences of activities, which we define as routines. In particular, we observe that two distinct classes of interdependencies—development and developer interdependencies—are associated with alternative forms of routine variation. We identify two generalized routine components—direct implementation and knowledge integration, which address these two distinct classes of unresolved interdependencies. In particular, direct implementation deals with development interdependencies within the code that are not already coordinated through modular interfaces, while knowledge integration resolves unaccounted interdependencies between developers. We conclude with implications for research into organizing principles for online communities and note the significance of our findings for the study of coordination in organization studies in general.},

  abstract = {Although our general knowledge about open source communities is extensive, we are only beginning to understand the increasingly common practices by which corporations design software through engagement with these communities. In response, we combine design theorizing with field-study research (1) to analyze rich qualitative data from over 40 corporations participating in the Linux open source community and (2) to synthesize the observed corporate-open source community engagements into a new type of information systems design theory that we call responsive design. Empirically, we document how corporate participants in these contexts respond to market decisions, interdependent ideologies, and distributed relationships by continuously establishing and maintaining connections with community members; connections that stem from the social and material rules inherent in the open source community. Based on these observations, we create the theory of responsive design as a particular form of corporate software design which, beyond the inclusion of external participants, distinguishes itself from traditional monocentric design in which one corporation controls a dedicated team of software designers focused on solving an isolated and singular organizational problem. Guided by the principles of interconnection, opportunism, and domestication, we define responsive design as the kind of design approach that enables corporate participants to create and maintain productive design practices in response to the complex and dynamic landscapes of activities that are the foundation of corporate-communal engagements. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this new form of corporate software design.},

Moreover, society may greatly benefit when software originators choose an open-source development strategy as their products become widely available, readily customizable, and open to community contributions. In this study, we present an economic model to study how software licensing attributes affect a software originator’s decisions, aiming to provide policy makers with insights into how welfare-improving, open-source outcomes can be incentivized. We show that when a competing contributor is apt at reaping the benefits of software development investment, a less restrictive open source license (e.g., Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD style) can improve welfare. On the other hand, when the originator is better at leveraging investment and service costs are high, a more restrictive license (e.g., General Public License, or GPL style) can be best for social welfare even when a contributor can cost-efficiently develop the software.

In writings on the open source software development model, it is often argued that it is successful as a result of the gift economy that embraces activities in online communities. However, the theoretical foundations for this argument are seldom discussed and empirically tested. Starting with the ‘classic’ theories of gift giving, we discuss how they need to be developed in order to explain gift-giving practices in digital domains. In this paper, we argue that the gift economy is important, not only because it creates openness, but also because it organizes relationships between people in a certain way. Open source software development relies on gift giving as a way of getting new ideas and prototypes out into circulation. This also implies that the giver gets power from giving away. This power is used as a way of guaranteeing the quality of the code. We relate this practice to how gifts, in the form of new scientific knowledge, are given to the research community, and how this is done through peer review processes.},

  abstract = {Motivation: To survive and succeed, FLOSS projects need contributors able to accomplish critical project tasks. However, such tasks require extensive project experience of long term contributors (LTCs). Aim: We measure, understand, and predict how the newcomers' involvement and environment in the issue tracking system (ITS) affect their odds of becoming an LTC. Method: ITS data of Mozilla and Gnome, literature, interviews, and online documents were used to design measures of involvement and environment. A logistic regression model was used to explain and predict contributor's odds of becoming an LTC. We also reproduced the results on new data provided by Mozilla. Results: We constructed nine measures of involvement and environment based on events recorded in an ITS. Macro-climate is the overall project environment while micro-climate is person-specific and varies among the participants. Newcomers who are able to get at least one issue reported in the first month to be fixed, doubled their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduced the odds. The precision of LTC prediction was 38 times higher than for a random predictor. We were able to reproduce the results with new Mozilla data without losing the significance or predictive power of the previously published model. We encountered unexpected changes in some attributes and suggest ways to make analysis of ITS data more reproducible. Conclusions: The findings suggest the importance of initial behaviors and experiences of new participants and outline empirically-based approaches to help the communities with the recruitment of contributors for long-term participation and to help the participants contribute more effectively. To facilitate the reproduction of the study and of the proposed measures in other contexts, we provide the data we retrieved and the scripts we wrote at https://www.passion-lab.org/projects/developerfluency.html.},

We used these techniques to statistically study how workload and involvement of ecosystem contributors varies across projects and across activity types, and we explored to which extent projects and contributors specialise in particular activity types. Using Gnome as a case study we observed that, next to coding, the activities of localization, development documentation and building are prevalent throughout the ecosystem. We also observed notable differences between frequent and occasional contributors in terms of the activity types they are involved in and the number of projects they contribute to. Occasional contributors and contributors that are involved in many different projects tend to be more involved in the localization activity, while frequent contributors tend to be more involved in the coding activity in a limited number of projects.},

  abstract = {Governance provides the authoritative framework for coordinating activities in open source development. Prior studies of open source governance have largely focused on its changing nature over time. In this work, we argue that the nature of governance varies across open source communities, and, in its evolution, multiple traces of authority may co-exist. We propose that such multiplicity can be understood by close examination of the authoritative structures embedded in coordination processes. We collected eight years of data on the coordination related to version control of the Linux kernel. Drawing on in-depth qualitative analysis, we investigate how coordination processes with different authoritative structures come together in the governance of open source software. We trace four coordination processes (autocratic clearing, oligarchic recursion, federated self-governance, and meritocratic idea-testing), each grounded in different authoritative structures (autocracy, oligarchy, federation, meritocracy) with their own form of legitimation. We offer a two-fold contribution in this paper. First, we enhance the open source governance literature by advancing a new theoretical perspective in which governance is seen as a configuration of coordination processes. Configurations give complementary support and are a source of tension and renewal. Second, we articulate a view on the conceptual relationship between governance and coordination where these concepts are understood as a duality, both working together to give rise to efficient and dynamic organizing in open source.},

Current perspectives emphasize innovation occurring either within firm boundaries or in the public arena. Open Source [OS] software development represents a third mode, where privately funded efforts contribute to the creation of a public good, which may presage future models of innovation. The authors develop a four-level management model of increasing private resource allocation based on a detailed discussion of how and why software and IT firms engage in OS development where, paradoxically, increased ‘public’ investment can lead to greater ‘private’ benefits. But each level implies greater outlay of private resources and increased dependency upon publicly available knowledge assets, so managers will need to select their firm's appropriate level of engagement carefully. Successful development of such knowledge entails understanding the nature of OS innovation and the distinction between freely available explicit knowledge and firms’ privately retained tacit knowledge, participating in the dynamic cumulative process of gift exchange inherent in acceptance as a relevant player in an OS community, and optimising firm-specific engagement over the four levels of investment and involvement to establish the conditions for knowledge creation and appropriation.},

This paper inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two software communities with different governance structures. In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code. Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine the advantages of open source software development with proprietary ownership and control are discussed.},

Our study contributes by revealing how the different motivations of OSS developers are interrelated, how these motivations influence participation leading to performance, and how past performance influences subsequent motivations. Drawing on theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, we develop a theoretical model relating the motivations, participation, and performance of OSS developers. We evaluate our model using survey and archival data collected from a longitudinal field study of software developers in the Apache projects. Our results reveal several important findings. First, we find that developers’ motivations are not independent but rather are related in complex ways. Being paid to contribute to Apache projects is positively related to developers’ status motivations but negatively related to their use-value motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence of diminished intrinsic motivation in the presence of extrinsic motivations; rather, status motivations enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that different motivations have an impact on participation in different ways. Developers’ paid participation and status motivations lead to above-average contribution levels, but use-value motivations lead to below-average contribution levels, and intrinsic motivations do not significantly impact average contribution levels. Third, we find that developers’ contribution levels positively impact their performance rankings. Finally, our results suggest that past-performance rankings enhance developers’ subsequent status motivations.},

We define two observable properties of an architecture: (1) modularity and (2) option value. Developers can often make informed judgments about modularity and option value from early, partially implemented code releases. We show that codebases that are more modular or have more option value (1) increase developers’ incentives to join and remain involved in an open source development effort and (2) decrease the amount of free riding in equilibrium. These effects occur because modularity and option value create opportunities for the exchange of valuable work among developers, opportunities that do not exist in codebases that are not modular or have no option value.},

We explain whether and under what conditions preexisting stocks of intellectual property rights can be useful complementary assets that allow firms to benefit directly or indirectly from commercializing OSS products, and test our hypotheses on a novel data set built on firms' announcements of OSS product releases in the specialized press between 1995 and 2003.

Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.},

Despite this, firms explicitly try to utilize the resources within these communities in order to create and appropriate value. Consequently, the relationships that firms have to these communities influence their way of doing business. Based on case studies of Nordic OSS firms, a typology consisting of symbiotic, commensalistic, and parasitic approaches to handle the firm–community relationship is developed. Depending on the chosen approach, firms encounter different managerial issues and also use different operational means of subtle control. While firms relying on a symbiotic approach have greater possibility to influence the community through subtle means of control, they are also confronted with more challenging managerial issues.},

  abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to explore how market orientation facilitates the strategic flexibility of business models grounded in open innovation. The authors suggest that the new paradigm of open innovation may impact a firm's adaptability and responsiveness under conditions of environmental flux. However, extending innovation capacity by opening the innovation process poses major challenges for firms. The aims of this study are to explore the characteristics of open innovation activity and to contemplate the role of strategic flexibility in the design of business models based upon open innovation.Design/methodology/approach – The study draws upon a qualitative research approach through a longitudinal case study in the field of open source software (OSS). The empirical case illustrates how an OSS firm utilizes signals in its environment to flexibly alter its business model.Findings – A business model that embodies open innovation raises dilemmas between open and closed innovation paradigms. However, the authors' case highlights that an ambidextrous approach that combines market orientation with the principles of open innovation increases profitability, shortens time to market through effective market access, and enhances innovation capability.Research limitations/implications – The results have profound implications for industrial marketers, managers, management consultants and business educators. They can use the insights gleaned from this research to guide the development of business models that involve open innovation. The results indicate that firms involved in open innovation need reactive strategic flexibility to cope with the environmental diversity and variability. However, this study analyzes a single case in the field of OSS and one should be cautious when generalizing the findings.Originality/value – This paper improves the understanding of the relationship between flexibility and market orientation. It combines two areas that have previously been discussed separately, i.e. market orientation and open innovation.},

  abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) is an important asset in today's software-intensive society. The success of OSS projects is highly dependent on a number of factors. These factors must be understood and managed as an OSS project progresses. Thus, project management of an OSS project has a decisive role in ensuring the success of its software. The objective of the research is to increase the understanding of the resources affecting the competitiveness of OSS projects. Herewith, the responsiveness of OSS projects to users' needs is assessed via an investigation of the defect-fixing process. A Resource-Based View of the firm (RBV) is used to build theoretical justifications for a set of hypotheses proposed in this study. Data gathered from 427 OSS projects confirmed that developers' interest in and users' contribution to the project as well as frequently updating and releasing the software affect the project's ability to gain competitive advantage through effective defect-fixing. It is also shown that OSS projects that are more popular and have a higher level of organizational communication than others are more likely to gain competitive advantage through effective defect-fixing. Finally, implications of the results for practitioners and the research community are presented.},

Petrosyan, Elena B. Yanovskaya and Olga N. Bondareva from the Soviet Union. The formalization of game theory (GT) took place prior to the Cold War but the geopolitical confrontation hastened and shaped its evolution. In our article we outline four similarities and differences between Western GT and Soviet GT: 1) the Iron Curtain resulted in a lagged evolution of GT in the Soviet Union; 2) Soviet GT focused more on operations research and issues of centralized planning; 3) the contemporary Western view on Soviet GT was biased and Soviet contributions, including works on dynamic stability, non-emptiness of the core and many refinements, suggest that Soviet GT was able to catch up to the Western level relatively fast; 4) international conferences, including Vilnius, 1971, fostered interaction between Soviet game theorists and their Western colleagues. In general, we consider the Cold War to be a positive environment for GT in the West and in the Soviet Union.},

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press publishedTheory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candiyears, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in theNew York Times, ttheAmerican Economic Review, and a variety of other publications.

In other words, why, in an activity that appears similar to others where women have gained ground, one cannot find an analogous process of incorporation? We propose a scheme of five related factors in order to analyse the genealogy of women’s exclusion from the world of software. First, we discuss the relation between gender and technologies in general, focusing on the initial stages of socialisation. Second, we fast forward a few years in the lives of boys and girls and we analyse their first interaction with digital technologies. Next, in relation to puberty or adolescence, we inquire into peer-group dynamics which are established by those who dedicate much of their time to computers. Fourth, we take into account the gender gap in college or bachelor degrees related to informatics. Lastly, we analyse the common representations of and beliefs about gender that employers hold in relation to informatics workers. These five parts of the explanation have different foundations. Some rely strongly on our qualitative fieldwork in Buenos Aires; others are based on texts or statistics which belong to other authors.},

For decades, scholars have studied polarization as an ideological matter—how strongly Democrats and Republicans diverge vis-à-vis political ideals and policy goals. Such competition among groups in the marketplace of ideas is a hallmark of a healthy democracy. But more recently, researchers have identified a second type of polarization, one focusing less on triumphs of ideas than on dominating the abhorrent supporters of the opposing party (1). This literature has produced a proliferation of insights and constructs but few interdisciplinary efforts to integrate them. We offer such an integration, pinpointing the superordinate construct of political sectarianism and identifying its three core ingredients: othering, aversion, and moralization. We then consider the causes of political sectarianism and its consequences for U.S. society—especially the threat it poses to democracy. Finally, we propose interventions for minimizing its most corrosive aspects.},

Democrats and Republicans both say that the other party's members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere. Finally, we discuss strategies that might mitigate partisan discord and conclude with suggestions for future work.},

Based on the system theory, a theoretical framework on analyzing opinion polarization combining big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) is proposed. A web crawler is used to collect data from the Sina Weibo platform on the topic of “Tangping”. Concerning the characteristics of the big data environment, social network analysis (SNA), machine learning, text clustering and content analysis are used to mine opinion polarization of “Tangping” on Weibo. Results show that social network users holding the same opinion indicate the phenomenon of aggregation. Although no influential users support the opinion of “Tangping” on Weibo, a high percentage of people advocate the idea. The supporting group has the most clusters while the opposing group has the highest density of keywords. The research contributes to the existing literature on applying BDAC to analyze online polarization from the perspective of the system from user behavior and interaction to topic clustering and keywords identification. The conceptual system framework shows superiority in the integration of information coordination of microsystem and exosystem. Guidance strategies are put forward to supplement the formation theory of opinion polarization and provide suggestions to reasonably regulate network group polarization.},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

  abstract = {Abstract The article discusses lower and higher contexts for information phenomena, and argues that there is clearly a need for a more concerted research effort in the latter sphere. The discipline of information science has traditionally favored lower contexts—like everyday life and problem solving—that are neutral or even negative by nature. In contrast, the neglected higher things in life are pleasurable or profound phenomena, experiences, or activities that transcend the daily grind. A literature sample of the scarce information research related to higher things indicates that beyond the spotlight of mainstream research, information processes often seem different and there may be significant dimensions of information phenomena that have been overlooked. Therefore, the article outlines a contextual research area in information studies to address higher things from the perspective of information. It is concluded that optimal functioning requires bringing the lower and higher sides to balance in information science. This would offer a rare chance to promote holism and interdisciplinarity in the field, and to make the discipline more relevant to the human being.},

In general, the conceptions reflect the acceptability, accessibility and usability of Internet sources. Most conceptions appeared to be quite impressionistic, reflecting the basic difficulty of describing the constantly changing nature of the Internet. Two major kinds of Internet conceptions were identified. First, in metaphorical conceptions, the Internet was primarily conceived in terms of space or place, for example, a library or a bazaar. Second, conceptions based on actual use experiences of the Internet significantly drew on quality judgments of the networked services. Since a growing number of information sources of various types are competing for people’s attention, general level conceptions of sources and channels will gain importance as a criterion by which sources will be accepted or rejected. This seems to be a particular characteristic of networked information environments.},

Reading a text is often not a simple process. All the methods discussed here are steps on the way on learning how to read, understand, and criticize texts. According to hermeneutics it involves the subjectivity of the reader, and that subjectivity is influenced, more or less, by different theoretical perspectives. Good, scholarly reading is to be aware of different perspectives, and to situate oneself among them.},

In this paper, we discuss the value of re-examining the information behaviour models in order to understand the skills and motivations necessary for the performance of different types of information activities. We also determine the benefits to be gained from the use of activity theory, with the aim of understanding and defining the literacies underlying the success of information activity. Engeström's model of conceptualization of the structure of activity is mainly explored to understand interrelated elements in information activity. The results of our research show that information literacy is essentially a social practice that cannot be reduced to the knowledge of information retrieval stages. These results lead us to think that an information literacy program should be perfectly integrated into its context of implementation and exploitation.},

A substantial `pedagogic' literature of learning in the workplace exists, however, and this was critically reviewed to generate a repertoire of issues which could in turn be used to inform a research project. This repertoire was supplemented by advice from the Scottish Information Literacy Project's partners and contacts including those working in Adult Literacies. These issues were used to generate research questions for an interview-based project which, it was hoped, would generate both action points and further research questions. With the help of partners a range of interviewees was identified, mainly in the public sector. Information usage in the workplace, as the pedagogic literature predicted, proved to be a form of social interaction with people, both within and outside the organization, being generally the prime source of information. Other sources included intranets, electronic resource data management systems, a limited range of Internet sites and a small number of printed sources. Recommendations include the need to establish contacts with chambers of commerce, skills agencies and trade unions. Public libraries should explore the possibility of developing information literacy training programmes.},

  abstract = {Information literacy (IL) research tends to fall into one of two spaces. In the conceptual space the research concern rests with understanding the experience and core elements of the practice and how it emerges. In the practical space the execution and outcome of the practice as markers of successful teaching and learning are the focus. The division between these spaces and the lack of researcher/practitioner convergence create a conundrum that limits our ability to theorise IL, to adequately situate IL in library and information science research, to champion its benefits outside the library and information science field, or to promote to funding bodies the impact of IL. To address this conundrum a theory and foundational model of IL is described which attempts to reconstruct the IL space and its enactments without privileging research or practice.

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of the research reported in this article is to understand how refugees learn to engage with a complex, multimodal information landscape and how their information literacy practice may be constructed to enable them to connect and be included in their new information landscape. Design/methodology/approach – The study is framed through practice and socio‐cultural theories. A qualitative research design is employed including semi‐structured face‐to‐face interviews and focus groups which are thematically analysed through an information practice lens. Findings – Refugees encounter complex and challenging information landscapes that present barriers to their full participation in their new communities. Social inclusion becomes possible where information is provided via sharing through trusted mediators who assist with navigating the information landscape and information mapping, and through visual and social sources. Research limitations/implications – The study is local and situated and therefore not empirically generalizable. It does however provide rich, deep description and explanation that is instructive beyond the specific research site and contributes to theory building. Practical implications – The study highlights the role, and importance, of social and visual information sources and the key role of service providers as mediators and navigators. Governments, funders and service providers can use these findings to inform their service provision. Originality/value – This is an original research paper in which the results provide practical advice for those working with refugees and which also extends theories of information literacy practice as an information practice.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The study aims to explore the interaction between the students, the material objects surrounding them, and their social site. The purpose of this paper is to identify and eluciyear information literacy as it is being enacted within a complex and heterogeneous community of PhD students. Design/methodology/approach – The study is conducted from a practice-based perspective, according to which information literacy is conceived as learnt through interaction within the socio-material practice where the learner is active. In order to produce empirical material, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten doctoral students in an interdisciplinary research network, and their workplaces were visited. Findings – The PhD students in this interdisciplinary network are more or less constantly engaged in the enactment of information literacy. It takes place in dialogue with others who can be both co-located and distantly located, and occurs through discussions about work in progress, through processes of evaluation and assessment of texts and authors, and through mundane everyday activities such as participating in meetings, which offer insights into how to navigate, in the broadest sense, the world of academia. A crucial part of the enactment of information literacy, which in practice is inseparable from interaction with others, is to pay attention to physical surroundings and material objects. Practical implications – The findings have implications for prospective PhD students in interdisciplinary fields, for their supervisors, and potentially also for librarians who are supposed to serve these groups. Originality/value – Research on the information literacies of PhD students in interdisciplinary fields is scarce. The practice-based approach applied in this study offers an extended and deepened understanding of the enactment of information literacy among PhD students in one interdisciplinary research practice.},

  abstract = {Information overload is a problem many of us can relate to nowadays. The deluge of user generated content on the Internet, and the easy accessibility to a vast amount of data compounds the problem of remembering and retaining information that is consumed. To make information consumed more memorable, strategies such as note-taking have been found to be effective by augmenting human memory under specific conditions. This is based on the rationale that humans tend to recall information better if they have produced the information themselves. Previous works in online education have shown that conversational systems can improve learning effects. Although memorization is an important part of learning, the effect of conversation on human memorability remains unexplored. We aim to address this knowledge gap through an experimental study, by investigating human memorability in a classical information retrieval setup. We explore the impact of note-taking affordances and conversational interfaces on the memorability of information consumed by users. Our results show that traditional web search and note-taking have positive effects on knowledge gain, while the search engine with a conversational interface has the potential to augment long-term memorability. This work highlights the benefits of using note-taking and conversational interfaces to aid human memorability. Our findings have important implications on building information retrieval systems that cater to optimizing memorability of information consumed.},

  abstract = {In this article the authors argue that progress in the development of information literacy (IL) has been hindered by tendencies such as: denying that information literacy is even a subject, paying exclusive attention to forces outside the discipline and forming information literacy silos. The authors start by reflecting on formative developments in information literacy outside North America in the late 1990s-early 2000s, and noting that IL has not evolved from that period as much as one might expect. They identify hindrances to information literacy’s formation as a discipline, and relate their discussion to changing notions of disciplinarity. The authors present ‘Information Literacy in the lifecourse’ as an example focus which could stimulate engagement from researchers and practitioners who are currently situated in different information literacy silos. They conclude that taking a disciplinary and lifecourse approach to information literacy would open up opportunities for working in a collegiate way, both within the information literacy community and with those outside it, and provide a more robust foundation for influencing policy.},

  abstract = {Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where software is developed by a networked community of individuals and organizations, which base their relations to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent research suggests that software development can actually be jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept collaborating in open source projects while running expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) with mining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research by exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that competition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., homophily) did not hold within the OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open source case, this research also contributes to the management literature in coopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on how heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups, established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena.},

In this research, we build upon extant theory on information literacy, rich media, and information seeking in the context of students' fitness and physical exercise. This is important as the students' practices of fitness and physical exercise can lead to desirable outcomes such as health, or negative outcomes such as injury. With a qualitative approach we address ``how students seek information in the context of fitness and physical exercise''. Grounded upon eight interviews and in-situ observations at a Nordic University, our preliminary findings point out that even if students exhibit elevated levels of literacy in academic issues, they seek and evaluate the information pertaining to their fitness and physical exercise in a quite different way from their academic issues. As expected, students prefer rich media information in digital format, but it is striking how every student consumes information in a highly customized unique way.},

Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems co-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words, understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially astute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other software ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in insulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed the OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to understand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We attempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to other software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to theoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing seven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each other: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic management of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and reputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs, competitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing the evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that software ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways, even with competing ones. A rigorous analysis of the evolution of a software ecosystem should not be solely confined to its inner boundaries.},

Nevertheless, there are very few empirical studies addressing release management in open source software development. It is already known that most open source software communities adopt either feature-based or time-based release strategies. Each of these has its advantages and disadvantages that are context-specific. Recent research reported that many prominent open source software projects have moved from feature-based to time-based releases. In this longitudinal case study, we narrate how OpenStack shifted towards a liberal six-month release cycle. If prior research discussed why projects should adopt time-based releases and how they can adopt such a strategy, we discuss how OpenStack adapted its software development processes, its organizational design and its tools toward a hybrid release management strategy --- a strive for balancing the benefits and drawbacks of feature-based and time-based release strategies.},

Systemic features are digital services enabling co-creation of value, not being products or services to be paid for, but assisting as consumer-supporting capabilities between different contexts. In order to gain better insight for systemic features within information systems, we collected empirical data from 23 firms in the high-tech sector and analyzed the systemic features. Systemic features were classified and prioritized by a research group. The created purpose-based typology enhances the understanding on why and how value is co-created with customers. We contribute both to systems and business research by suggesting a purpose-based typology defining different purpose-based constructs for systemic features enabling co-creation of value. We also discuss implications for managing and organizing value within the firm and contribution to organization science and theory of the firm.},

  abstract = {The dictum of ``Release early, release often.'' by Eric Raymond as the Linux modus operandi highlights the importance of release management in open source software development. However, there are very few empirical studies addressing release management in this context. It is already known that most open source software communities adopt either a feature-based or time-based release strategy. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages that are also context-specific. Recent research reports that many prominent open source software projects have overcome a number of recurrent problems by moving from feature-based to time-based release strategies. In this longitudinal case study, we address the release management practices of OpenStack, a large scale open source project developing cloud computing technologies. We discuss how the release management practices of OpenStack have evolved in terms of chosen strategy and timeframes with close attention to processes and tools. We discuss the number of practical and managerial issues related to release management within the context of large and complex software ecosystems. Our findings also reveal that multiple release management cycles can co-exist in large and complex software ecosystems such as OpenStack.},

Through an empirical research on the gendered evolution of migrants' personal networks over their settlement process, the article illustrates the depth and explanatory strength of a methodology that combines the algebraic and formalised reasoning of the analysis of networks' matrixes with a comprehensive approach of the actors' narratives. The paper identifies theoretical foundations and methodological approaches that enable to analyse social networks with deep sociological lens. It advocates for a ``strong'' integration in combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies that helps to abandon the realist premises of the classical tradition of SNA in order to integrate the interpretative tradition of social sciences. This approach enables taking into account the content of relationships and the situated interactions that create and maintain the networks; and to comprise the social and institutional context where they are produced in order to overcome implicit rational thinking about the behaviour of the individuals embedded in relational structures.},

The possible ties among nodes of a network are regarded as random variables, and assumptions about dependencies among these random tie variables determine the general form of the exponential random graph model for the network. Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs.

  abstract = {The most promising class of statistical models for expressing structural properties of social networks observed at one moment in time is the class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models. The strong point of these models is that they can represent a variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity, that define complicated dependence patterns not easily modeled by more basic probability models. Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been developed that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators. Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence problems of estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data. This paper proposes new specifications of exponential random graph models. These specifications represent structural properties such as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions, alternating k-triangles, and alternating independent two-paths. Examples are presented both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the new specifications lead to much better results than the earlier existing specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that the new specifications increase the range and applicability of the ERGM as a tool for the statistical analysis of social networks.},

  abstract = {Modern multilevel analysis, whereby outcomes of individuals within groups take into account group membership, has been accompanied by impressive theoretical development (e.g. Kozlowski and Klein, 2000) and sophisticated methodology (e.g. Snijders and Bosker, 2012). But typically the approach assumes that links between groups are non-existent, and interdependence among the individuals derives solely from common group membership. It is not plausible that such groups have no internal structure nor they have no links between each other. Networks provide a more complex representation of interdependence. Drawing on a small but crucial body of existing work, we present a general formulation of a multilevel network structure. We extend exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to multilevel networks, and investigate the properties of the proposed models using simulations which show that even very simple meso effects can create structure at one or both levels. We use an empirical example of a collaboration network about French cancer research elites and their affiliations (Lazega et al., 2006, Lazega et al., 2008) to demonstrate that a full understanding of the network structure requires the cross-level parameters. We see these as the first steps in a full elaboration for general multilevel network analysis using ERGMs.},

However, there is a certain amount of confusion about network theory—for example, what it is, what is distinctive about it, and how to generate new theory. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by clarifying the fundamental concepts of the field (such as the network) and characterizing how network reasoning works. We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J. Sociol. 78(6) 1360–1380] and Burt's structural holes theory [Burt, R. S. 1992. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition. Havard University Press, Cambridge, MA], to identify characteristic elements of network theorizing. We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model. We close with a discussion of the merits of model-based network theorizing for facilitating the generation of new theory, as well as a discussion of endogeneity in network theorizing.},

This typology includes traditional types of nodes, like people, and traditional types of relations, like “shares information with,” along with types of nodes that are technological artifacts, like databases, and types of nonhuman relations, like embodiment. In this way, technology is moved inside the social network and becomes an inherent part of it. An illustrative case shows how the inclusion of nonhuman artifacts and relations in the networks of an automobile design firm significantly changes our understanding of the emergent dynamics in this sociomaterial network. These results are extended by an exploration of how to develop multidimensional, multitheoretical, and multilevel models that include technological artifacts and relations.},

In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known{—}a collaboration network and a food web{—}and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

Using this review as a foundation, we propose a future research agenda in this domain that focuses the on the relative influence of network effects and platform quality in competitive outcomes, drivers of indirect network effects, the nature and attributes of complementors, and leveraging complementor dynamics for competitive advantage. Managerial summary: In many industries, such as social networks and video games, consumers place greater value on products with a large network of other users and a large variety of complementary products. Such “network effects” offer lucrative opportunities for firms that can leverage these dynamics to create dominant technology platforms.

@article{Benkler2002,
  abstract = {For decades our common understanding of the organization of economic production has been that individuals order their productive activities in one of two ways: either as employees in firms, following the directions of managers, or as individuals in markets, following price signals. This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Ronald Coase and was developed most explicitly in the work of institutional economist Oliver Williamson. Recently, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old phenomenon called free software or open source software. This phenomenon involves thousands, or even tens of thousands, of computer programmers who collaborate on large- and small-scale projects without traditional firm-based or market-based ownership of the resulting product. This Article explains why free software is only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon emerging in the digitally networked environment, a third mode of production that the author calls "commons-based peer production." The Article begins by demonstrating the widespread use of commons-based peer production on the Internet through a number of detailed examples, such as Wikipedia, Slashdot, the Open Directory Project, and Google. The Article uses these examples to reveal fundamental characteristics of commons-based peer production that distinguish it from the property- and contract-based modes of firms and markets. The central distinguishing characteristic is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals rather than market prices or managerial commands. The Article then explains why this mode has systematic advantages over markets and managerial hierarchies in the digitally networked environment when the object of production is information or culture. First, peer production has an advantage in what the author calls "information opportunity cost," because it loses less information about who might be the best person for a given job. Second, there are substantial increasing allocation gains to be captured from allowing large clusters of potential contributors to interact with large clusters of information resources in search of new projects and opportunities for collaboration. The Article concludes with an overview of how these models use a variety of technological, social, and formal strategies to overcome the collective action problems usually solved in managerial and market-based systems by property, contract, and managerial commands. This Article contends that the common understanding of Miranda as a direct restraint on custodial interrogation by police is mistaken. Instead, Miranda, like the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination that serves as its constitutional foundation, is a rule of admissibility. As the text of the privilege, the Supreme Court's Fifth Amendment jurisprudence, and the Miranda majority's reasoning all demonstrate, neither the privilege nor Miranda can be violated without use of a compelled statement in a criminal case. Miranda controls police conduct only indirectly, by requiring suppression of statements taken in violation of the Miranda rules. At least two significant consequences flow from this understanding. First, police violations of the Miranda rules alone cannot support civil lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Second, and more importantly, police have no constitutional obligation to comply with the Miranda warnings and waiver regime. Rather, police are free to disregard Miranda if they deem it advantageous. If the Supreme Court had fashioned a stringent Miranda exclusionary doctrine-one similar to that which applies when prosecutors compel testimony by use of immunity grants-police would have good reason to comply with the Miranda rules even absent a constitutional duty. But, the Court has done the opposite, creating a host of evidentiary incentives for police to violate those rules. Thus, it is not surprising that some police officers and departments deliberately disregard Miranda in order to benefit from those incentives. Because many federal appellate courts already have interpreted Miranda as a rule that governs only admissibility, and there is a good chance that the Supreme Court will construe the privilege accordingly when it decides Chavez v. Martinez this Term, Miranda's future appears bleak. It is likely that the Court will signal to police that they have no constitutional duty to follow Miranda rules and, at the same time, will leave intact its decisions tempting police to violate those rules. This Article offers an alternative approach, one by which the Court squares its Miranda doctrine with its treatment of the privilege in other contexts. This proposed approach would manyear that the Court treat Miranda as a rule of admissibility but also would require that it rethink many of the decisions that entice police to violate the Miranda rules.},

We investigate the competing OSS and proprietary software products with comparable functionalities in four different scenarios depending on whether they are compatible with each other and whether the underlying market is fully covered (i.e., all consumers adopt one of the two products). Furthermore, we study which party has the most incentive to make its product compatible with its counterpart. When the market is fully covered, the installed base and the profit of proprietary software increase at the expense of a decreasing user base for OSS in the presence of network externalities. This competitive imbalance becomes more pronounced when OSS and proprietary software are incompatible and the market is partially covered. Finally, we find that in the presence of network externalities, being compatible with its rival is not desirable for the proprietary software, but highly beneficial to the OSS community.},

We develop a framework to characterize the optimal two-sided pricing strategy of a platform firm; that is, the pricing strategy toward the direct users of the platform as well as toward firms offering applications that are complementary to the platform. We compare industry structures based on a proprietary platform (such as Windows) with those based on an open source platform (such as Linux), and analyze the structure of competition and industry implications in terms of pricing, sales, profitability, and social welfare. We find that, when the platform is proprietary, the equilibrium prices for the platform, the applications, and the platform access fee for applications may be below marginal cost, and we characterize demand conditions that lead to this. The proprietary applications sector of an industry based on an open source platform may be more profitable than the total profits of a proprietary platform industry. When users have a strong preference for application variety, the total profits of the proprietary industry are larger than the total profits of an industry based on an open source platform. The variety of applications is larger when the platform is open source. When a system based on an open source platform with an independent proprietary application competes with a proprietary system, the proprietary system is likely to dominate the open source platform industry both in terms of market share and profitability. This may explain the dominance of Microsoft in the market for PC operating systems.},

  abstract = {A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for interactions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

Organizational exchange is defined as any voluntary activity between two organizations which has consequences, actual or anticipated, for the realization of their respective goals or objectives. Organizations have need for three main elements: (1) clients, (2) labor services, and (3) resources other than labor services. Theoretically, were all the essential elements in infinite supply there would be little need for organizational interaction and for subscription to co-operation as an ideal for health agencies. Under conditions of scarcity, however, interorganizational exchanges are essential to goal attainment. The interdependence of the agencies is contingent upon three related factors: (1) the accessibility of each organization to necessary elements from outside the health system, (2) the objectives of the organization and particular functions to which it allocates the elements it controls, and (3) the degree to which domain consensus exists among the various organizations.},

  abstract = {Despite the availability of source code, deploying open source software in an enterprise environment requires skills. Recent surveys and case studies show that the skills of IT staff in an organization are one of the key factors in open source software adoption decisions. Another important factor organizations consider when choosing a platform is network effects. This paper studies how users’ skills and network effects may influence the market where proprietary software competes with open source software. In the model, users make adoption decisions considering their own skills and the network effects of the software, and the proprietary software vendor prices its product strategically. It is found that in the presence of network effects, the proprietary software dominates the market when the open source software does not provide higher benefits to users. This implies that open source software, as a low-cost substitute to proprietary software, may not survive in a market exhibiting network effects. To gain market share, open source software has to outperform proprietary software by a large margin, which can be achieved when a significant portion of users are highly skilled and thus can customize the open source software to better satisfy their needs.},

Thus, in this article, we merge two prevalent views from past research, namely, the organization and the project-centric views on innovation management into a concept map. We then describe how these views complement each other. The resulting concept map contains new concepts that provide better coverage of how innovation currently takes place within ecosystems and shows how internal and external drivers are key to the innovation in SECOs. With this article, we want to open the floor to further discussion on how internal and external drivers can be effective in propelling innovation of both traditional (closed) and open-source SECOs. We solicit future work to expand on this view and to achieve a more complete understanding of how SECOs are connected to innovation.},

Results show that cooperation with rival and non-rivals taken together increases economic performance, but that the impact of cooperation with rivals is lower than the impact of cooperation with non-rivals. Estimation results suggest that reaping the full cooperation benefits is not automatic and requires precision dosing and management.},

Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems co-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words, understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially astute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other software ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in insulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed the OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to understand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We attempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to other software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to theoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing seven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each other: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic management of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and reputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs, competitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing the evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that software ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways, even with competing ones. A rigorous analysis of the evolution of a software ecosystem should not be solely confined to its inner boundaries.},

Our approach allows us to observe how key events in the mobile-device industry have affected the WebKit collaboration network over time. With our findings, we show the explanation power from network visualizations capturing the collaborative dynamics of a high-networked software project over time; and highlight the power of the open-source fork concept as a nexus enabling both features of competition and collaboration.

  abstract = {Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where software is developed by a networked community of individuals and organizations, which base their relations to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent research suggests that software development can actually be jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept collaborating in open source projects while running expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) with mining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research by exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that competition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., homophily) did not hold within the OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open source case, this research also contributes to the management literature in coopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on how heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups, established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena.},

  abstract = {A model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. The model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.},

  abstract = {Commercial participation continues to grow in open source software (OSS) projects and novel arrangements appear to emerge in company-dominated projects and ecosystems. What is the nature of these novel arrangements' Does volunteers' participation remain critical for these ecosystems' Despite extensive research on commercial participation in OSS, the exact nature and extent of company contributions to OSS development, and the impact of this engagement may have on the volunteer community have not been clarified. To bridge the gap, we perform an exploratory study of OpenStack: a large OSS ecosystem with intense commercial participation. We quantify companies' contributions via the developers that they provide and the commits made by those developers. We find that companies made far more contributions than volunteers and the distribution of the contributions made by different companies is also highly unbalanced. We observe eight unique contribution models based on companies' commercial objectives and characterize each model according to three dimensions: contribution intensity, extent, and focus. Companies providing full cloud solutions tend to make both intensive (more than other companies) and extensive (involving a wider variety of projects) contributions. Usage-oriented companies make extensive but less intense contributions. Companies driven by particular business needs focus their contributions on the specific projects addressing these needs. Minor contributors include community players (e.g., the Linux Foundation) and research groups. A model relating the number of volunteers to the diversity of contribution, shows a strong positive association between them.},

  abstract = {Open-source software poses a serious challenge to proprietary software vendors. “Lock in customers” seems a tempting strategy for proprietary software vendors, who attempt to lock in customers by creating switching costs. This paper examines whether such a lock-in strategy will indeed benefit proprietary software vendors facing competition from open-source software, who can credibly commit future prices. Developing a two-period duopoly model in which software products are differentiated and customers are heterogeneous, we find that the lock-in strategy is actually counterproductive in competing against open-source software. In fact, giving customers the freedom of choice may end up benefiting the proprietary software vendor. In terms of the broader effect, we find that lock-in reduces overall social welfare, but certain customers may actually be better off with it. Finally, we show that the lock-in strategy works differently for different types of customers in the software market (i.e., foresighted versus myopic customers). This suggests that customer behavior could significantly alter the equilibrium strategy of software vendors.},

We conceive of selective revealing as a strategic mechanism to reshape the collaborative behavior of other actors in a firm's innovation  ecosystem. We propose that selective revealing may provide an effective alternative to known collaboration mechanisms, particularly under conditions of high partner uncertainty, high coordination costs, and unwilling potential collaborators. We specify conditions when firms are more likely to reveal knowledge and highlight some boundary conditions for competitor reciprocity. We elaborate on strategies that allow firms to exhibit managerial agency in selective revealing and discuss selective revealing's implications for theories of organization and open innovation and for management practice.},

  abstract = {At the heart of the network neutrality debate is a challenging institutional design problem: the selection of a regime to govern the relations between the stakeholders in the complex value net of advanced communication services, most importantly between platform operators and providers of applications and content. How it is resolved will have far-reaching effects on the future evolution of communication industries. A wide spectrum of arrangements to structure these relations is possible, ranging from a minimally restrictive antitrust approach to highly constraining rules and regulations in a framework of full regulation. Based on a stylized model, the paper examines the innovation incentives of platform operators and content providers in next-generation networks under three scenarios: (1) absence of network neutrality rules, (2) various non-discrimination rules, and (3) full regulation. The discussion reveals that no panacea exists to address the potential problems raised by the network neutrality debate. Alternative specifications of rules will result in different innovation trajectories at the platform and content layers and the system overall. Given the lack of knowledge and the high degree of uncertainty, a strategy of monitoring, combined with a willingness and authorization to intervene if a pattern of abuse becomes visible, seems to be the most appropriate immediate step forward.},

Authors developing typologies, however, have been criticized for developing simplistic classification systems instead of theories. Contrary to these criticisms, we argue that typologies meet the criteria of a theory. When typologies are properly developed and fully specified, they are complex theories that can be subjected to rigorous empirical testing using the quantitative models we develop. We conclude by discussing the advantages of typological theories and presenting guidelines to improve the development of typologies.},

  abstract = {Scholars have recently highlighted the promise of open innovation. In this paper, we treat open innovation—in it's different forms and manifestations—as well as internal or closed innovation, as unique governance forms with different benefits and costs. We discuss how each governance form, whether open or closed, is composed of a set of instruments that access (a) different types of communication channels for knowledge sharing, (b) different types of incentives, and (c) different types of property rights for appropriating value from innovation. We focus on the innovation “problem” as the central unit of analysis, arguing for a match between problem types and governance forms, which vary from open to closed and which support alternative forms of solution search. In all, the goal of this paper is to provide a comparative framework for managing innovation, where we delineate and discuss four categories of open innovation governance forms (markets, partnerships, contests and tournaments and user or community innovation) and compare them with each other and with two internal or closed forms of innovation governance (authority and consensus-based hierarchy).},

  abstract = {The paradox of openness describes the fundamental tension between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection in open innovation. While sharing is vital for value creation, protecting is critical for value appropriation. Prior research has examined this paradox of openness from the perspective of the seeking firm, focusing on the firm-level challenges of inbound open innovation. In this article, we complement that research by illuminating the tensions between sharing and protecting in individual-level outbound open innovation, where we argue that the paradox of openness is most prevalent, yet much less well understood. Drawing on the experience of individual participants, or solvers, in intermediated crowdsourcing contests, we analyze textual data from 2,149 answers to five open-ended narrative questions embedded in a large-scale solver survey, as well as 43 in-depth interviews of solvers. Our findings indicate that individual solvers face fundamental sharing-protecting tensions that carry considerable economic and psychological costs. We also document how solvers attempt to navigate the paradox of openness by employing three formal and four informal value appropriation practices. They build elaborate configurations of these practices, which they tailor to the idiosyncrasies of each contest. They also dynamically adjust these configurations over time, as the contest and the interaction with the seeker unfold. We end by outlining how these findings contribute to a more multifaceted conceptualization and a richer understanding of the paradox of openness.},

  abstract = {Open source software is now "business as usual" in the mobile industry. While much attention is given to the importance of open source licenses, we argue in this article that the governance model can be as necessary to a project{’}s success and that projects vary widely in the governance models - whether open or closed - that they employ. Open source governance models describe the control points that are used to influence open source projects with regard to access to the source code, how the source code is developed, how derivatives are created, and the community structure of the project. Governance determines who has control over the project beyond what is deemed legally necessary via the open source licenses for that project. The purpose of our research is to define and measure the governance of open source projects, in other words, the extent to which decision-making in an open source project is "open" or "closed". We analyzed eight open source projects using 13 specific governance criteria across four areas of governance: access, development, derivatives and community. Our findings suggest that the most open platforms will be most successful in the long term, however we acknowledge exceptions to this rule. We also identify best practices that are common across these open source projects with regard to source code access, development of source code, management of derivatives, and community structure. These best practices increase the likelihood of developer use of and involvement in open source projects.},

  abstract = {The term open government is often used to describe initiatives of putting government information on the Internet. This conceptualization is too restricted since open government is not only about openness in informational terms (vision) but also about openness in interactive terms (voice). On the basis of an analysis of 103 articles, this article provides insight into the concepts of openness, transparency and participation, their interactions, and the manner in which they have been discussed in the literature. This analysis shows the differences and similarities between economic, political science and legal perspectives on open government and argues that a multidisciplinary approach needs to be taken. The authors conclude that open government is much too important to leave it to the ‘techies’: scientists and practitioners with backgrounds in law, economics, political science and public administration should also get involved to build sound connections between vision and voice that facilitate active citizenship.Points for practitioners This article provides guidelines for the realization of open government: (1) design open government for synergistic or complementary relationships between transparency and participation, (2) design open government for a diverse population, (3) design open government for direct and indirect effects, (4) design open government acknowledging a variety in desirables and (5) design for continuous learning about effects and side-effects. The authors emphasize that a diversified approach to the design of open government will be more fruitful in the long run than merely understanding it in terms of making information publicly available.},

  abstract	= {This paper analyses a major episode in contemporary
		  biomedical research using a new semi-quantitative approach.
		  In the late 1970s, immunologists began producing new kinds
		  of antibodies targeting molecules on the surface of normal
		  and malignant blood cells. These tools quickly transformed
		  biomedical research in immunology and oncology-hematology.
		  Laboratories worldwide produced thousands of these new
		  reagents and reorganized the classification, diagnosis, and
		  prognosis of diseases such as leukemia and the lymphomas.
		  The rapid development of these reagents initially generated
		  considerable confusion. To avoid the impending chaos,
		  researchers in the field, officially supported by the World
		  Health Organization and the International Union of
		  Immunological Societies, launched an ongoing series of
		  distributed workshops that led to the establishment of a
		  nomenclature of antibody reagents and cell surface
		  molecules. The First Workshop (1981-82) mobilized 54
		  research groups from 14 countries and resulted in the
		  establishment of 15 antibody/molecule categories. By the
		  late 1990s the number of these categories had increased to
		  more than 247 and the number of participating laboratories
		  had risen to more than 500. Sociological analyses of this
		  kind of large-scale collaborative research usually adopt
		  one of two equally unsatisfactory alternatives: either they
		  provide thick descriptions of selected sites, thus missing
		  the figurational dimension of the collaborative network, or
		  they attempt to account for figurational complexity by
		  reducing it to a few quantitative indicators, thus
		  destroying for all practical purposes the very phenomena
		  under investigation. To avoid these two alternatives, we
		  opted for a combination of ethnographic methods
		  (interviews, content analysis) and a computer-based
		  analysis of the more than 6000 antibodies examined during
		  the first six workshops, using Réseau-Lu, a software
		  program specifically designed for the treatment of
		  heterogeneous relational data.},

  abstract	= {The apparent success of free/libre open source software
		  (FLOSS) development projects such as Linux, Apache, and
		  many others has raised the question, what lessons from
		  FLOSS development can be transferred to mainstream software
		  development? In this paper, we use coordination theory to
		  analyze coordination mechanisms in FLOSS development and
		  compare our analysis with existing literature on
		  coordination in proprietary software development. We
		  examined developer interaction data from three active and
		  successful FLOSS projects and used content analysis to
		  identify the coordination mechanisms used by the
		  participants. We found that there were similarities between
		  the FLOSS groups and the reported practices of the
		  proprietary project in the coordination mechanisms used to
		  manage task-task dependencies. However, we found clear
		  differences in the coordination mechanisms used to manage
		  task-actor dependencies. While published descriptions of
		  proprietary software development involved an elaborate
		  system to locate the developer who owned the relevant piece
		  of code, we found that
		  {\textquotedblleft}self-assignment{\textquotedblright} was
		  the most common mechanism across three FLOSS projects. This
		  coordination mechanism is consistent with expectations for
		  distributed and largely volunteer teams. We conclude by
		  discussing whether these emergent practices can be usefully
		  transferred to mainstream practice and indicating
		  directions for future research.},

  doi		= {10.1177/1094428109351319},
  abstract	= {To provide evidence-based strategies for ensuring rigor of
		  case studies, the authors examine what rigor types authors
		  report and how they report them by content analyzing all
		  case studies published 1995–2000 in 10 management
		  journals. Comparing practices in articles addressing rigor
		  extensively and less extensively, the authors reveal three
		  strategies for insuring rigor. First, very few case study
		  authors explicitly label the rigor criteria in terms of the
		  concepts commonly used in the positivist tradition
		  (construct, internal, and external validity, as well as
		  reliability). Despite this, papers addressing rigor
		  extensively do report concrete research actions taken to
		  ensure methodological rigor. Second, papers addressing
		  rigor extensively prioritized rigor types: more, and more
		  detailed, strategies were reported for ensuring internal
		  and construct validity than for external validity. Third,
		  emergent strategies used in the field were reported, such
		  as setbacks and serendipities, that necessitated changes to
		  the originally planned research procedures. Authors focus
		  squarely on the concrete research actions taken, carefully
		  relaying them to the reader so that the reader may
		  appreciate the logic and purpose of trade-off decisions in
		  the context of the specific case study.},

abstract ={
               The engagement of firms in multiple simultaneous strategic alliances with different partners has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today’s business landscape. This article offers a review of the extant alliance portfolio literature and organizes it around three key research areas: (a) the emergence of alliance portfolios, (b) the configuration of alliance portfolios, and (c) the management of alliance portfolios. The article also highlights existing gaps in the present understanding of alliance portfolios and outlines a research agenda by identifying key research questions and issues in the areas where further research is needed.

@Article{	  teixeira2015lessons,
  abstract	= {Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a
		  single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where
		  software is developed by a networked community of
		  individuals and organizations, which base their relations
		  to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent
		  research suggests that software development can actually be
		  jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known
		  that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept
		  collaborating in open source projects while running
		  expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study
		  approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the
		  open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that
		  combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) with
		  mining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network
		  Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes
		  within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to
		  Software Engineering research by exploring the role of
		  groups, sub-communities and business models within a
		  high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results
		  point out that competition for the same revenue model
		  (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not
		  necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem.
		  Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of
		  the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected
		  social tendency of developers to work with developers from
		  same firm (i.e., homophony) did not hold within the
		  OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel,
		  complex and unexplored open source case, this research also
		  contributes to the management literature in coopetition
		  strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich
		  description on how heterogeneous actors within a
		  high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups,
		  established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a
		  complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source
		  arena.},

However, the extent to which multilevel research is overtly practiced remains to be examined. This article analyzes 10 years of organizational research within a multilevel framework (from 2001 to 2011). The goals of this article are (a) to understand what has been done, during this decade, in the field of organizational multilevel research and (b) to suggest new arenas of research for the next decade. A total of 132 articles were selected for analysis through ISI Web of Knowledge. Through a broad-based literature review, results suggest that there is equilibrium between the amount of empirical and conceptual papers regarding multilevel research, with most studies addressing the cross-level dynamics between teams and individuals. In addition, this study also found that the time still has little presence in organizational multilevel research. Implications, limitations, and future directions are addressed in the end.},

abstract = "Understanding when entrants might have an advantage over an industry's incumbent firms in developing and adopting new technologies is a question which several scholars have explained in terms of technological capabilities or organizational dynamics. This paper proposes that the value network—the context within which a firm competes and solves customers' problems—is an important factor affecting whether incumbent or entrant firms will most successfully innovate. In a study of technology development in the disk drive industry, the authors found that incumbents led the industry in developing and adopting new technologies of every sort identified by earlier scholars —at component and architectural levels; competency-enhancing and competency-destroying; incremental and radical—as long as the technology addressed customers' needs within the value network in which the incumbents competed. Entrants led in developing and adopting technologies which addressed user needs in different, emerging value networks. It is in these innovations, which disrupted established trajectories of technological progress in established markets, that attackers proved to have an advantage. The rate of improvement in product performance which technologists provide may exceed the rate of improvement demanded in established markets. This mismatch between trajectories enables firms entering emerging value networks subsequently to attack the industry's established markets as well. "

The structural holes theory sees network ties as opportunities linking together separate network segments through brokers and weak ties. The opposing view argues that network closure would generate superior “social capital” and thus superior “economic rent” as we would have more trust, reputation and cooperation within a closed group with strong internal ties. We discuss these theories in the context of multilateral airline alliances and argue that the two concepts in combination advance our ability to explain alliance processes in the airline industry. "

Defying conventional wisdom on the negative effects of uncompensated spillovers, innovative users also often openly reveal their innovations to competing users and to manufacturers. Rival users are thus in a position to reproduce the innovation in-house and benefit from using it, and manufacturers are in a position to refine the innovation and sell it to all users, including competitors of the user revealing its innovation. In this paper, we explore the incentives that users might have to freely reveal their proprietary innovations. We then develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users’ decisions to reveal or hide their proprietary information. We find that, under realistic parameter constellations, free revealing pays. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings. "

 abstract = {The capabilities offered by digital communication are leading to the evolution of new network structures that are grounded in communication patterns. As these structures are significant for organizations, much research has been devoted to understanding network dynamics in ongoing processes of electronic communication. A valuable method for this objective is Social Network Analysis. However, its current focus on quantifying and interpreting aggregated static relationship structures suffers from some limitations for the domain of analyzing online communication with high volatility and massive exchange of timed messages. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a method for event-based dynamic network visualization and analysis together with its exploratory social network intelligence software Commetrix. Based on longitudinal data of corporate email communication, the paper demonstrates how exploration of animated graphs combined with measuring temporal network changes identifies measurement artifacts of static network analysis, describes community formation processes and network lifecycles, bridges actor level with network level analysis by analyzing the structural impact of actor activities, and measures how network structures react to external events. The methods and findings improve our understanding of dynamic phenomena in online communication and motivate novel metrics that complement Social Network Analysis.},

The results of the study suggest that communication does affect organizational commitment, that communication affects job satisfaction (employee morale), but that job satisfaction does not affect organizational commitment. A model of these relationships is proposed.},

Increasingly, however, organizations are concerned about the production of information. This paper focuses on the work of producing informational objects, an activity central to knowledge work. Based on data collected during an eight-month ethnographic study of three groups of knowledge workers-computer system administrators, competitive intelligence analysts, and librarians-I explore the informing practices they relied upon. These are identified as ex-pressing, monitoring, and translating. Common to these informing practices is the knowledge workers' endeavor to balance subjectivity and objectivity, where subjectivity is a necessary part of doing value adding work and objectivity promises workers authority and a sense of security. Recognizing that researchers are knowledge workers too, I draw on my own experiences as an ethnographic researcher to identify parallels between my informing practices and those of the knowledge workers I studied. These parallels are intended to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying scientific practice. I adopt a confessional genre of representation for this purpose.},

  abstract = {The implementation of new information technology (IT) often aims at transforming work practices. The information systems (IS) literature has detailed numerous cases of reproduction or changes of practice associated with IT use. The literature has also drawn from the practice and structurationist perspectives to suggest that changes in practice are related to changes in organizations. The micro-level issue of how practices change with IT use, however, has so far remained under-explored. This paper investigates this issue and analyzes what makes agents transform how they work with IT and how these transformations may be shared among members of the same work group. The conceptual lens proposed in this paper builds on the emerging literature in IS on the relationships between action and cognition, and introduces the notion of social representations to the IS field in order to clarify these relationships. The adopted conceptual lens helps us to examine a longitudinal case study of the implementation and use of an intranet system in an occupational network. The analysis suggests that practices are reproduced with IT use when agents experience a sustained consonance between actions, practices and representations. Conversely, when agents undergo dissonance between actions, practices and representations, they gradually adapt their practices and representations to reestablish consonance.},

But how does the position of a firm in its alliance network weighted by the centrality of its partners—a concept which we term “partner-weighted alliance centrality”—and the heterogeneities in the types of partners that it cooperates with—in terms of its private-public collaboration—influence this quest? Using longitudinal data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, we build alliance networks in the period 1985–2001 to investigate these questions. We show that, for breakthrough innovation, collaborating with more partners that are more central in alliance networks the better, but only to a point. Beyond that point, we find that the likelihood of achieving breakthrough innovation drops. Furthermore, and looking at the kinds of knowledge provided by the partners in each firm's alliances, we report that firms with a greater share of private partners, relative to public partners, suffer less from the diminishing benefits of collaboration with central partners when developing breakthrough innovation. Taken together, we make novel contributions about how to organize for breakthrough innovation, and provide actionable managerial advice in terms of selecting collaborative partners in alliance networks.},

Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) has actively encouraged the use of case methods, resulting in many important theoretical advances in the field. However, debate still rages over what constitutes “good case research”. This article addresses this issue from a positivist standpoint. We examine the how authors address issues of quality in the 105 qualitative case studies published in IMM between 1971 and 2006. Four periods were identified: 1971–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999, and 2000–2006. Findings demonstrate that, from a positivist viewpoint, there has been a steady improvement in how authors addressed issues of research quality in published qualitative case studies. Suggestions for changes in data presentation, reviewer expectations, the IMM reviewer feedback form, and the use of web-based appendices containing data pertinent to reader judgments of research quality are suggested.},

  abstract = {Case research has commanded respect in the information systems (IS) discipline for at least a decade. Notwithstanding the relevance and potential value of case studies, this methodological approach was once considered to be one of the least systematic. Toward the end of the 1980s, the issue of whether IS case research was rigorously conducted was first raised. Researchers from our field (e.g., Benbasat et al. 1987; Lee 1989) and from other disciplines (e.g., Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 1994) called for more rigor in case research and, through their recommendations, contributed to the advancement of the case study methodology. Considering these contributions, the present study seeks to determine the extent to which the field of IS has advanced in its operational use of case study method. Precisely, it investigates the level of methodological rigor in positivist IS case research conducted over the past decade. To fulfill this objective, we identified and coded 183 case articles from seven major IS journals. Evaluation attributes or criteria considered in the present review focus on three main areas, namely, design issues, data collection, and data analysis. While the level of methodological rigor has experienced modest progress with respect to some specific attributes, the overall assessed rigor is somewhat equivocal and there are still significant areas for improvement. One of the keys is to include better documentation particularly regarding issues related to the data collection and analysis processes.},

Triangulation is recommended as good practice in conducting case study research and is traditionally envisaged as offering validity through convergence of findings, sources or methods. Is this, however, the only interpretation of triangulation and in what way is it consistent with case study research that is often concerned with naturalistic settings and nuanced interpretations? The purpose of this study is to delve into the role of triangulation in qualitative case study research in order to re-appraise its role. The study offers firstly, an inventory of triangulation categories for case study research in industrial marketing and secondly, a theoretical reframing of triangulation consisting of three modes - convergence, complementarity and divergence. Both the inventory and the reframing are discussed with reference to illustrations of published case studies, thus extending current understanding of research practice in industrial marketing.},

Comparing practices in articles addressing rigor extensively and less extensively, the authors reveal three strategies for insuring rigor. First, very few case study authors explicitly label the rigor criteria in terms of the concepts commonly used in the positivist tradition (construct, internal, and external validity, as well as reliability). Despite this, papers addressing rigor extensively do report concrete research actions taken to ensure methodological rigor. Second, papers addressing rigor extensively prioritized rigor types: more, and more detailed, strategies were reported for ensuring internal and construct validity than for external validity. Third, emergent strategies used in the field were reported, such as setbacks and serendipities, that necessitated changes to the originally planned research procedures. Authors focus squarely on the concrete research actions taken, carefully relaying them to the reader so that the reader may appreciate the logic and purpose of trade-off decisions in the context of the specific case study.},

  abstract = {Events happen within the organizational world not by chance but for reasons. It is surely the task of management research to try to explain why these events occur. This requires us to understand the nature of causality but, in general, this is seldom discussed in the management or IS literature. The standard, positivist view underlying statistical analysis is the Humean one of constant conjunctions of events leading to universal laws. Against this, many constructivists find the whole idea of external causality implausible. In this paper we explore a third alternative that is developing strongly within the philosophy of science, social theory and critical realism – the mechanisms view. This proposes that events are generated through the interaction of specific mechanisms endowed with causal powers that may or may not be triggered, and may or may not be countervailed. In particular, the paper develops some of the fundamental concepts such as the nature of events, emergent properties, the difference between properties and powers, casual interactions between levels, absences as causes, event causality and generative causality, and abstracting causal regularities. The paper concludes by illustrating these ideas with a series of empirical case studies.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to promote a greater use of informal conversations in qualitative research. Although not a new innovation, we posit that they are a neglected innovation and a method that should become more widely employed. We argue that these conversations create a greater ease of communication and often produce more naturalistic data. While many researchers have written about the use of informal conversations in ethnography, as part of participant observation, we are advocating that these conversations have an application beyond ethnography and can be used in more general qualitative exploration that occurs in everyday settings where talking is involved. They can be used as the main method but also to complement and add to more formal types of data created through interview. Sometimes informal conversations are not only the best way, they are the only way to generate data. We use examples to show how we have used informal conversations in our research, which we interrogate and use to raise a number of, mainly ethical and methodological, issues. We discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of using this method, including the status and validity of data produced.},

  abstract = {Abstract The idea of this editorial research article is to start making sense out of the seemingly limitless debate on the environmental dimension of sustainable development. We have evaluated a collection of international peer-reviewed papers. These contributions have been debated at the conferences of the International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS). Our main research objective here is to consider the often posed question of why the progress made in sustainable development has been so slow and the work implemented so unsuccessful. We argue that one of the main explanations is that the approaches used in sustainable development are reductionist and often lead into problem shifting and problem displacement. To address the problem of reductionism, we propose what we call ‘strategic thinking’ and its incorporation into sustainable development work in general. To open up this argument, we arrive at the discussion of three central dimensions of strategic thinking and the relevance of these dimensions when addressing reductionism. These dimensions are the strategy content, strategy process and strategy context. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \\& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to identify the characteristics of refugee-entrepreneurial startups, which distinguish them from other immigrant entrepreneurial ventures. The author employed a single case analysis as a means of qualitative research into the phenomenon under study, from the perspective of social capital theory. A typical case of a refugee entrepreneur was selected based on his propensity to tell his story in a way that transparently reveals the various peculiarities of his entrepreneurial behavior. The case study involved the use of interviews with key individuals, the review of printed materials, and member checking. The findings revealed five distinctive attributes that characterized that startup and which corresponded to the three dimensions of social capital. Those attributes were: a ‘one-way-ahead’ attitude, a pseudo family business perception, collective bootstrapping, a distinct network structure, and opportunity-seizing proliferation, thereby depicting how social capital is used by refugee-entrepreneurs to maximize the pool of opportunities in their host nations.},

Entrepreneurship has been praised as a promising route to refugee self-reliance, but its viability remains contested and under-researched in developed economies such as Germany. Limited literature on the topic suggests entrepreneurship is a useful route to self-sufficiency, although refugees face more barriers than other immigrant entrepreneurs, such as language barriers and bureaucratic processes. This article uses semi-structured interviews with refugee entrepreneurs, civil society, social enterprises and the public sector to identify the main challenges for refugee entrepreneurs and to examine whether entrepreneurship is effective for achieving self-reliance in one of the most important centres for creating innovative projects supporting refugee inclusion and entrepreneurship, namely Berlin. Though it is too early to demonstrate whether entrepreneurship has long-term economic gains, this research shows that entrepreneurship is not a ‘fast track’ to economic self-reliance, but has several benefits for social inclusion. It also demonstrates the importance of holistic support systems for refugee entrepreneurs and the difficulty of refugee entrepreneurial success even in the most developed economies.},

Publication numbers have been on the rise, especially in the last ten years, yet, there is very little mutual acknowledgement and discussions arising between researchers, as revealed by a bibliometric analysis. A content analysis shows three main waves of publications based on countries of origin, countries of residence, and migration timeframes. The vast majority of publications take on an exploratory approach to research, with diverse theoretical framings from an array of disciplines, and the thematic clusters reveal how researchers are attempting to tease out the distinctiveness of refugee entrepreneurs from other, closely related entrepreneurship groups.},

  abstract = {Europe faces the challenge of enormous recent asylum seeker inflows, and the allocation of these immigrants across European countries remains severely skewed, with some countries having a much larger per capita share of asylum applicants than others. Consequently, there is a debate at the EU level on how to allocate asylum seekers in order to tackle this imbalance. The present study focuses on preferences of European citizens towards the supranational policy issue of achieving a more equalized distribution of asylum seekers. Several theoretical arguments point towards asylum seeker intake, general immigrants’ legal status, prior immigration stocks, and economic circumstances as explanatory mechanisms at the macro level. We test these propositions using Eurobarometer data from 2015. The results show that a high level of asylum seeker intake and larger immigrant stocks in 2010 are associated with a greater willingness to redistribute asylum seekers. Apart from this, integration policies also play a role: the more inclusive a country’s political stance towards Third-Country Nationals, the higher the public support for a better allocation of asylum seekers. These results also emerge when excluding the top five asylum seeking destinations. At the individual level, views of the EU as a competent political actor and general immigration attitudes are substantially related to the support for redistribution efforts. These individual-level patterns occur both in countries with many and in countries with few asylum seekers, indicating that respondents largely take a broad European view on this topic, rather than a national one.},

  abstract = {Abstract A social identity framework was employed to understand why people support the exclusionary treatment of refugee claimants (‘asylum seekers’) in Australia. Over and above individual difference effects of social dominance orientation and individuals' instrumental threat perceptions, insecure intergroup relations between citizens and asylum seekers were proposed to motivate exclusionary attitudes and behaviour. In addition, perceived procedural and distributive fairness were proposed to mediate the effects of social identity predictors on intergroup competitiveness, serving to legitimise citizens' exclusionary behaviours. Support for these propositions was obtained in a longitudinal study of Australians' social attitudes and behaviour. Small and inconsistent individual-level effects were noted. In contrast, after controlling for these variables, hostile Australian norms, perceived legitimacy of citizen status, and threatening socio-structural relations were strongly and consistently linked to intentions to support the harsh treatment of asylum seekers, and exclusionary attitudes and action at Time 2. Moreover, perceived procedural and distributive justice significantly mediated these relationships. The roles of fairness and intergroup socio-structural perceptions in social attitudes and actions are discussed. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \\& Sons, Ltd.},

As of 2022, around 27 million people were registered as refugees with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). While some consider refugees to be a burden on their host countries, there is growing evidence that they make significant contributions to host countries’ economies, with rates of entrepreneurship higher than other migrant groups and host country nationals. To take stock of what is known about refugee entrepreneurship, this article undertakes a systematic review of the refugee entrepreneurship empirical literature. The systematic review provides insights into the factors which shape refugees’ initiation of, engagement in, and performance of entrepreneurial endeavors and identifies gaps and inconsistencies in the current refugee entrepreneurship literature. Based on these gaps and inconsistencies, a future research agenda is proposed. By taking stock of what is known and proposing a future research agenda, this review has scholarly implications for the academic advancement of refugee entrepreneurship. Additionally, this review has policy implications. By better understanding the field of refugee entrepreneurship and its social and economic benefits, government policy-makers will be better positioned to design responsive policies to support refugee entrepreneurs in establishing their entrepreneurial endeavors. Finally, the findings of this review have practical implications for refugee entrepreneurs themselves, for example, by highlighting the resources that will assist entrepreneurs in pursuing entrepreneurship.},

We sought to test these associations using the latest data from 21 EU countries, and also whether the associations were moderated by the share of unemployed people in each region and individuals’ labor situation. Methods We analyzed the second release of the 2016 European Social Survey which includes different questions about attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, as well as a rich variety of socioeconomic variables. Multilevel Poisson regression models were developed, regressing fair/poor health on attitudes towards immigrants \& refugees. Results For each one point increase in favorable attitudes toward immigrants, the prevalence of fair/poor health was reduced by 2 percentage points (PR = 0.98; 95\\%CI: 0.96–0.99). In analyses incorporating cross-level interactions, the association was not moderated by high background unemployment rates or individual labor market attachment. Conclusion Positive attitudes toward immigrants are correlated with lower prevalence of fair/poor health in general, regardless of individuals’ labor situation and the objective economic situation. Fostering empathy toward immigrants and refugees may thus promote a healthier society, especially among more prejudiced individuals.},

To explore this issue, we conducted interviews with 19 refugee business owners residing in New Zealand. Our findings concur with the extant literature that refugee-owned businesses generate economic, social and cultural value in their adopted countries. However, these businesses can be differentiated by their value focus; that is, whether the business' sole focus is economic or a nuanced blend, where economic value is complemented by strong social and cultural outcomes. In addition, these businesses' blended value generation is concentrated in either ethnic/co-ethnic or to local host communities. We use the findings to construct a typology of value generated by refugee-owned businesses, based on two continuums: from economic value to blended value and from ethnic/co-ethnic focus to local host focus.},

  abstract = {Refugee entrepreneurship is increasingly viewed as a viable means for refugees to gain self-reliance and integrate into their host countries. Yet, given the diversity of institutional contexts that host refugees, calls have been made to expand research on how institutions influence refugee entrepreneurship. We respond to this call by presenting herein an abductive study of Syrian refugee entrepreneurs in an emerging market (Egypt) who managed to establish and maintain entrepreneurial ventures despite institutional voids (i.e., where key institutions are either missing or underperforming). The work offers an extension of the institutional voids perspective for studying refugee entrepreneurs, known as “refugee-economy voids.” These account for the influence of national and international formal and informal institutions on refugee entrepreneurs. To address refugee-economy voids, we also discuss three strategies used by refugee entrepreneurs: (a) masking strategies, (b) jockeying strategies, and (c) informal crowdfunding strategies. This paper also provides new evidence dealing with the supportive role and solidarity of the host country’s nationals with refugee entrepreneurs. On a policy level, the findings can inform the development of targeted policy interventions to address refugee-economy voids across different host countries and to improve support for refugees’ self-reliance through entrepreneurship.},

  abstract = {Canada continues to be a prominent immigrant and refugee-receiving country in worldwide migration, resettlement, and search for refuge, yet there is a gap in our understanding of these newcomers’ views of the specific meanings of social support and their support needs and resources. The purpose of this study was to understand the meanings of social support for immigrants and refugees in Canada, and to explore the types and adequacy of formal supports. Individual interviews were conducted with 60 service providers and policymakers initially (Phase 1), and 120 immigrants and refugees (60 Chinese, 60 Somali) in the second phase. The implications of these findings were elicited in group interviews (Phase 3) of policy decision-makers, advocates, service providers, and managers. This investigation revealed many interrelated challenges facing refugees and immigrants such as language difficulties, inadequate information on services, poor health, racism, needs for retraining, rejection of foreign qualifications, unemployment, social isolation, social insecurity, dwindling social networks, and family conflicts. The study also illuminated culturally and socio-economically determined perceptions of social support and support-seeking strategies. Limited personal resources and dwindling social networks are an impediment to coping with integration and settlement challenges. In many cases, newcomers’ efforts to seek help are thwarted by systemic obstacles. Newcomers experienced extensive unmet support needs, which service providers cannot adequately meet due to bureaucratic and resource constraints. Policies in various sectors that affect the lives of immigrants and refugees are inadequate for bridging their support deficiencies. These support gaps hinder the successful settlement and integration of newcomers. Policies and programs fostering culturally relevant support, and inter-sectoral collaboration among organizations addressing the support needs of immigrants and refugees are timely.},

  abstract = {Abstract Drawing on social capital theory, we develop a theoretical model aiming to explore how open source software (OSS) project effectiveness (in terms of team size, team effort and team's level of completion) is affected by expertise integration. This in turn is influenced by three types of social capital – relational capital, cognitive capital and structural capital. In addition, this study also examines two moderating effects – the impact of technical complexity on the relationship between cognitive capital and expertise integration, and of task interdependence on the relationship between expertise integration and task completion. Through a field survey of 160 OSS members from five Taiwanese communities, there is support for some of the proposed hypotheses. Both reciprocity and centrality affect expertise integration as expected, but the influence of commitment and cognitive capital (including expertise and tenure) on expertise integration is not significant. Finally, expertise integration affects both team size and team effort, which in turn jointly influence task completion. This research contributes to advancing theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of free OSS development as well as providing OSS practitioners with insight into how to leverage social capital for improving the performance of OSS development.},

  abstract = {Open source software (OSS) communities live and die with the continuous contributions of programmers who often participate without direct remuneration. An intriguing question is whether such sustained participation in OSS projects yields economic benefits to the participants. Moreover, as participants engage in OSS projects, they take on different roles and activities in the community. This raises additional questions of whether different forms of participation in OSS communities are associated with different economic rewards and, if so, in which contexts. In this paper, we draw upon theories of signaling and job matching to hypothesize that participants who possess “proof” of their skills in OSS projects are financially rewarded for their activities in the labor market. More specifically, we distinguish between participation in OSS communities that is associated with a signaling value for unobserved productivity characteristics and an additional value that accrues to participants whose OSS roles and activities match those in their paid employment. Following a cohort of OSS programmers over a six-year period, we empirically examine the wages and OSS performance of participants in three of the foremost OSS projects operating within the Apache Software Foundation. Controlling for individual characteristics and other wage-related factors, our findings reveal that credentials earned through a merit-based ranking system are associated with as much as an 18\\% increase in wages. Moreover, we find that participants who have OSS project management responsibilities receive additional financial rewards if their professional job is in IT management. These findings suggest that rank within an OSS meritocracy is a credible and precise signal of participants' productive capacity and that participants' roles and activities in an OSS community have additional financial value when aligned with their paid employment.},

In this study, our main goal is to better understand the relationship between adoption of library versions and its release cycle. Specifically, we conducted an empirical study of release cycles for 23 libraries and how they were adopted by 415 Apache Software Foundation (ASF) client projects. Our findings show that software projects are quicker to upyear earlier rapid-release libraries compared to library projects with a longer release cycle. Moreover, results suggest that software projects are more likely to adopt the latest version of a rapid-release library compared to libraries with a longer release cycles.},

Three competitors dominate the market with its short selling season, and release delays slash profits. Tax authorities issue upyears August—December, and all changes must be processed and incorporated before year end. Systematic resource allocation and process management are crucial yet problematic due to the volume and complexity of changes, brief production time frame, and feedback loops for bug resolution. A leading tax software provider asked us to propose systematic approaches for managing process flow and staffing development stages with the goal of releasing the new version on time at minimum cost. To that end, we developed deterministic models that partitioned tax forms into development groups and determined staffing levels for each group. Partitioning forms into groups simplified workflow management and staffing decisions. To provide a range of resource configurations, we used two modeling approaches. Numerical experiments showed that our models capture the salient features of the process and that our heuristics perform well. Implementing our models reduced company overtime hours by 31\% and total workforce cost by 13\%.},

  abstract = {Abstract High-tech companies conducting product development need to collect and analyze requirements effectively, plan and implement releases, and allocate requirements to appropriate releases. Requirements and release management are complicated because development activities typically are scattered across multiple sites, involve multiple partners in different countries, leverage various development methods and tools, and are realized through various organizational arrangements such as release projects in organizations structured around products and permanent release teams in organizations responsible for the long-term development and maintenance of strategic software and hardware assets. Flexible, scalable, and secure groupware-based support for the activities provides substantial payoffs. Yet, the extant literature provides little theoretical guidance for designing and using requirements and release management systems (RRMS) in multi-site, multi-partner environments. This article develops the meta-requirements and a meta-design of an Information Systems Design Product Theory for the class of RRMS based on a case study in a global company and a literature review. The theory is scalable to meet the needs of global companies but simple enough so that small and medium-sized companies can also leverage it to implement requirements and release management solutions.

  abstract = {Modern release engineering practices provide multiple benefits for software companies, but organizations have struggled when trying to adopt the most advanced practices, such as continuous delivery. It is not known in which contexts the most advanced practices are applicable and what can be achieved by adopting them. In this study, we discuss the effect of the organizational context on adopted release engineering practices and what outcomes are achieved with the practices. We study two organizational contexts: the startup and the large mature company context. The effect of the product context is mitigated by studying two case organizations with similar products, a rare research opportunity. We performed 18 interviews with various roles in the case organizations. The number of production environments, the number of customers, the control over the production environment, the available resources, the organization size and the distribution of the organization affected the release engineering practices and the ability to release frequently. Having less internal verification and more customer verification enabled fast feedback and customer experimentation in the startup context, but increased the number of production defects. However, having more internal verification in the large mature company context surprisingly did not prevent production defects. The organizational context had a large effect on how achievable modern release engineering practices, such as continuous delivery, were. In the startup context, the lack of resources was the main factor hindering the improvement of release engineering practices, while in the large mature company context, the number of stakeholders and products were the main factors.},

These systems realize advanced features by embedded software and enable the distribution of functionality as required, for example, by safety equipment. Different life cycle times of mechanical, software and hardware components as well as different duration of their development processes require efficient coordination. Furthermore, product-driven process structures, dynamic adaptation of these structures, and handling real-world exceptions result in challenging demands for any IT system. In this paper we elaborate fundamental requirements for the IT support of car development processes, taking release management as characteristic example. We show to which extent current product data and process management technology meets these requirements, and discuss which essential limitations still exist. This results in a number of fundamental challenges requiring new paradigms for the product-driven design, enactment and adaptation of processes.},

It is particularly challenging in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystems, in which hundreds of loosely connected developers and their projects are coordinated to release software to a schedule. To better understand this process and its challenges, we analyzed over two and half years of communication in the GNOME ecosystem and studied developers' interactions. Through a case study, we cataloged communication channels, determined the main channel from which we categorized high level communication and coordination activities spanning five releases, and triangulated our results by interviewing ten key developers. We found that a release schedule, influence (instead of direct control), and diversity are the main factors that positively impact the release process in the GNOME ecosystem. We report a set of lessons learned that encapsulates our understanding of how the Release Management process function in a FOSS ecosystem, we learned that: (1) ensure that the release team follows the main communication channels used by developers, (2) provide a common place for coordination for an ecosystem, (3) consider including both good technical and social skills in a release team, (4) aim for a diverse release team, (5) based on lack of power, lobbying and consensus based management must be followed, (6) help the release team in the coordination process with a well defined schedule, and (7) release team work is different from regular software work. Our results can help organizations build better large-scale teams and show that research focused on individual projects might miss important parts of the picture.},

The success of the OSS model is also setting the stage for a structural change in the software industry; it is beginning to transform software industry from manufacturing to a service industry. Despite the success of the OSS model, for-profit organizations are having difficulty building a business model around the open source paradigm. Whereas there are some isolated empirical studies, little rigorous research has been done on how traditional organizations can implement and benefit from OSS practices. This research explores how organizations can foster an environment similar to OSS to manage their software development efforts to reap its numerous advantages. Drawing on organizational theory, we develop a framework that guides the creation and management of a hybrid-OSS community within an organization. We discuss the implications of this framework and suggest areas for future research.},

Often labeled as "internal open source" (IOS), several large firms have started to implement these programs. Research to year has mostly focused on facilitating IOS adoption. In the present research, we focus on how IOS affects reuse. Employing a qualitative case study, we examine the IOS program at IBM called "Community Source." Analyzing data gathered from multiple sources reveals that IOS adoption facilitates participatory reuse by enhancing information sharing and leveraging of broader community skills. Participatory reuse manifests itself when potential reusers participate in the entire development process leading to the creation of reusable assets. Based on data, we develop a theoretical model to illustrate how IOS affects reuse. While furthering research on IOS and reuse, the model informs managers wishing to foster participatory reuse that they are wise to adopt IOS as a vehicle to promote greater openness of the software development infrastructure for leveraging broader community skills and enhancing information sharing among projects' stakeholders.},

This has led to an increased interest of firms toward the development of software with high level of efficiency; which can be achieved by incorporating beta tests for improving and ensuring that the software is safe and completely free from errors. In a software release life cycle, beta testing is the last important step that software developers carry out before they launch new software. Beta testing is a unique testing process that helps software developers to test a software product in different environments before its final release in the market. In this chapter of the book, we develop a SRGM by inculcating the concept of beta testing in the fault removal process to account for situations that might occur when the software is used in diverse environments. This is done to evade the chances of system being failed in the field. Conducting beta tests results in enhancement of software reliability and has been widely acknowledged. Furthermore, we have developed an optimal scheduling model and showed the importance of beta test while determining the general availability time of the software and making the system more cost effective. For validating the accuracy and predictive capability of the proposed model, we analyzed it on real software data set.},

  abstract = {Purpose Fierce competition drives software vendors to rely on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) strategies and to continuously match new releases with customers’ needs and competitors’ moves. Such recurrent release practices pose specific challenges for software vendors which shape how they service customers. To address these challenges, this paper aims to apply service science to innovate strategies for SaaS release management. Design/methodology/approach Based on action research methodology, the authors collaborated closely with Software Inc., an alias for a large multinational software provider, to apply service-dominant logic systematically, to analyze and improve its SaaS release management process and to support ongoing value co-creation with its customers. Findings The authors provide a detailed account of how Software Inc. improved its SaaS release management practices; they extend current understanding of service innovation dynamics in SaaS environments and offer a model of value co-creation in SaaS release management grounded in the findings from Software Inc. Research limitations/implications The research draws on a single case study with particular characteristics. Still, it allows for analytical generalizations with both theoretical and practical implications for how SaaS managers can improve recurrent release practices based on foundational service-dominant logic principles. Practical implications The authors suggest that SaaS managers concentrate on knowledge-sharing with customers, ensure continuous communication among teams supporting the service, re-organize release management to enhance the value co-creation process, use technology to improve customer service experiences and use service mapping to improve release management and service quality. Originality/value The authors bridge service-dominant logic principles and SaaS knowledge by demonstrating how service-dominant logic can be used to improve SaaS release practices and by offering conceptual and practical knowledge about value co-creation between customers and suppliers in SaaS contexts.},

  abstract = {Patch management is a crucial component of information security management. An important problem within this context from a vendor's perspective is to determine how to release patches to fix vulnerabilities in its software. From a firm's perspective, the issue is how to upyear vulnerable systems with available patches. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to study the strategic interaction between a vendor and a firm in balancing the costs and benefits of patch management. Our objective is to examine the consequences of time-driven release and upyear policies. We first study a centralized system in a benchmark scenario to find the socially optimal time-driven patch management. We show that the social loss is minimized when patch-release and upyear cycles are synchronized. Next, we consider a decentralized system in which the vendor determines its patch-release policy and the firm selects its patch-upyear policy in a Stackelberg framework, assuming that release and upyear policies are either time driven or event driven. We develop a sufficient condition that guarantees that a time-driven release by the vendor and a time-driven upyear by the firm is the equilibrium outcome for patch management. However, in this equilibrium, the patch-upyear cycle of the firm may not be synchronized with the patch-release cycle of the vendor, making it impossible to achieve the socially optimal patch management in the decentralized system. Therefore, we next examine cost sharing and liability as possible coordination mechanisms. Our analysis shows that cost sharing itself may achieve synchronization and social optimality. However, liability by itself cannot achieve social optimality unless patch-release and upyear cycles are already synchronized without introducing any liability. Our results also demonstrate that cost sharing and liability neither complement nor substitute each other. Finally, we show that an incentive-compatible contract on cost sharing can be designed to achieve coordination in case of information asymmetry.},

@article{ChoudharyZhang2015,
  abstract = {This paper extends prior research on the software vendors’ optimal release time and patching strategy in the context of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS). Traditionally, users are responsible for running on-premises software; by contrast, a vendor is responsible for running SaaS software, and the SaaS vendor incurs a larger proportion of defect-related costs than a vendor of on-premises software. We examine the effect of this difference on a vendor’s choice of when to release software and the proportion of software defects to fix. Surprisingly, we find that, despite incurring a larger proportion of defect-related costs, it is optimal for the SaaS vendor to release software earlier and with more defects, and to patch a smaller proportion of defects, than the on-premises software vendor. Even though the SaaS vendor incurs higher defect-related costs, he obtains a larger profit than the traditional vendor. In addition, we find that for a vendor who uses the SaaS model, the optimal number of defects after patching may be lower than the socially efficient outcome. This occurs despite the fact that the number of defects after patching in the SaaS model is higher than in the traditional on-premises model.},

  abstract = {Abstract Drawing on social capital theory, we develop a theoretical model aiming to explore how open source software (OSS) project effectiveness (in terms of team size, team effort and team's level of completion) is affected by expertise integration. This in turn is influenced by three types of social capital – relational capital, cognitive capital and structural capital. In addition, this study also examines two moderating effects – the impact of technical complexity on the relationship between cognitive capital and expertise integration, and of task interdependence on the relationship between expertise integration and task completion. Through a field survey of 160 OSS members from five Taiwanese communities, there is support for some of the proposed hypotheses. Both reciprocity and centrality affect expertise integration as expected, but the influence of commitment and cognitive capital (including expertise and tenure) on expertise integration is not significant. Finally, expertise integration affects both team size and team effort, which in turn jointly influence task completion. This research contributes to advancing theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of free OSS development as well as providing OSS practitioners with insight into how to leverage social capital for improving the performance of OSS development.},

It is already known that most open source software communities adopt either feature-based or time-based release strategies. Each of these has its advantages and disadvantages that are context-specific. Recent research reported that many prominent open source software projects have moved from feature-based to time-based releases. In this longitudinal case study, we narrate how OpenStack shifted towards a liberal six-month release cycle. If prior research discussed why projects should adopt time-based releases and how they can adopt such a strategy, we discuss how OpenStack adapted its software development processes, its organizational design and its tools toward a hybrid release management strategy --- a strive for balancing the benefits and drawbacks of feature-based and time-based release strategies.},

The questions, then, are what criteria, if any, are used in determining the suitability for release of a particular version of this software, and do users have any degree of confidence in the quality of that release of software? These questions were examined in this study using information from the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), the primary forum for discussion of development issues of the Linux kernel, and change logs submitted with version releases of the Linux kernel. It was determined that very little planning is employed in determining the release of a particular version of the software and that a version of the software is essentially a collection of source patches released at regular intervals with some stabilisation of the code base before each release. Very little attempt is made to verify that the code is bug free, and consequently, the code released is of a largely unknown level of quality.

In this paper, we draw upon theories of signaling and job matching to hypothesize that participants who possess “proof” of their skills in OSS projects are financially rewarded for their activities in the labor market. More specifically, we distinguish between participation in OSS communities that is associated with a signaling value for unobserved productivity characteristics and an additional value that accrues to participants whose OSS roles and activities match those in their paid employment. Following a cohort of OSS programmers over a six-year period, we empirically examine the wages and OSS performance of participants in three of the foremost OSS projects operating within the Apache Software Foundation. Controlling for individual characteristics and other wage-related factors, our findings reveal that credentials earned through a merit-based ranking system are associated with as much as an 18\\% increase in wages. Moreover, we find that participants who have OSS project management responsibilities receive additional financial rewards if their professional job is in IT management. These findings suggest that rank within an OSS meritocracy is a credible and precise signal of participants' productive capacity and that participants' roles and activities in an OSS community have additional financial value when aligned with their paid employment.},

This is because the latest version may include additional developer effort to test and integrate all changed features. In this study, our main goal is to better understand the relationship between adoption of library versions and its release cycle. Specifically, we conducted an empirical study of release cycles for 23 libraries and how they were adopted by 415 Apache Software Foundation (ASF) client projects. Our findings show that software projects are quicker to upyear earlier rapid-release libraries compared to library projects with a longer release cycle. Moreover, results suggest that software projects are more likely to adopt the latest version of a rapid-release library compared to libraries with a longer release cycles.},

  abstract = {Every year, companies that produce commercial tax preparation software struggle with thousands of state and federal changes to tax laws and forms. Three competitors dominate the market with its short selling season, and release delays slash profits. Tax authorities issue upyears August—December, and all changes must be processed and incorporated before year end. Systematic resource allocation and process management are crucial yet problematic due to the volume and complexity of changes, brief production time frame, and feedback loops for bug resolution. A leading tax software provider asked us to propose systematic approaches for managing process flow and staffing development stages with the goal of releasing the new version on time at minimum cost. To that end, we developed deterministic models that partitioned tax forms into development groups and determined staffing levels for each group. Partitioning forms into groups simplified workflow management and staffing decisions. To provide a range of resource configurations, we used two modeling approaches. Numerical experiments showed that our models capture the salient features of the process and that our heuristics perform well. Implementing our models reduced company overtime hours by 31\% and total workforce cost by 13\%.},

  abstract = {Abstract High-tech companies conducting product development need to collect and analyze requirements effectively, plan and implement releases, and allocate requirements to appropriate releases. Requirements and release management are complicated because development activities typically are scattered across multiple sites, involve multiple partners in different countries, leverage various development methods and tools, and are realized through various organizational arrangements such as release projects in organizations structured around products and permanent release teams in organizations responsible for the long-term development and maintenance of strategic software and hardware assets. Flexible, scalable, and secure groupware-based support for the activities provides substantial payoffs. Yet, the extant literature provides little theoretical guidance for designing and using requirements and release management systems (RRMS) in multi-site, multi-partner environments. This article develops the meta-requirements and a meta-design of an Information Systems Design Product Theory for the class of RRMS based on a case study in a global company and a literature review. The theory is scalable to meet the needs of global companies but simple enough so that small and medium-sized companies can also leverage it to implement requirements and release management solutions.

It is not known in which contexts the most advanced practices are applicable and what can be achieved by adopting them. In this study, we discuss the effect of the organizational context on adopted release engineering practices and what outcomes are achieved with the practices. We study two organizational contexts: the startup and the large mature company context. The effect of the product context is mitigated by studying two case organizations with similar products, a rare research opportunity. We performed 18 interviews with various roles in the case organizations. The number of production environments, the number of customers, the control over the production environment, the available resources, the organization size and the distribution of the organization affected the release engineering practices and the ability to release frequently. Having less internal verification and more customer verification enabled fast feedback and customer experimentation in the startup context, but increased the number of production defects. However, having more internal verification in the large mature company context surprisingly did not prevent production defects. The organizational context had a large effect on how achievable modern release engineering practices, such as continuous delivery, were. In the startup context, the lack of resources was the main factor hindering the improvement of release engineering practices, while in the large mature company context, the number of stakeholders and products were the main factors.},

The coordination and synchronization of these processes has become a complex and error-prone task due to the increasing number of functions and embedded systems in modern cars. These systems realize advanced features by embedded software and enable the distribution of functionality as required, for example, by safety equipment. Different life cycle times of mechanical, software and hardware components as well as different duration of their development processes require efficient coordination. Furthermore, product-driven process structures, dynamic adaptation of these structures, and handling real-world exceptions result in challenging demands for any IT system. In this paper we elaborate fundamental requirements for the IT support of car development processes, taking release management as characteristic example. We show to which extent current product data and process management technology meets these requirements, and discuss which essential limitations still exist. This results in a number of fundamental challenges requiring new paradigms for the product-driven design, enactment and adaptation of processes.},

It is particularly challenging in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystems, in which hundreds of loosely connected developers and their projects are coordinated to release software to a schedule. To better understand this process and its challenges, we analyzed over two and half years of communication in the GNOME ecosystem and studied developers' interactions. Through a case study, we cataloged communication channels, determined the main channel from which we categorized high level communication and coordination activities spanning five releases, and triangulated our results by interviewing ten key developers. We found that a release schedule, influence (instead of direct control), and diversity are the main factors that positively impact the release process in the GNOME ecosystem. We report a set of lessons learned that encapsulates our understanding of how the Release Management process function in a FOSS ecosystem, we learned that: (1) ensure that the release team follows the main communication channels used by developers, (2) provide a common place for coordination for an ecosystem, (3) consider including both good technical and social skills in a release team, (4) aim for a diverse release team, (5) based on lack of power, lobbying and consensus based management must be followed, (6) help the release team in the coordination process with a well defined schedule, and (7) release team work is different from regular software work. Our results can help organizations build better large-scale teams and show that research focused on individual projects might miss important parts of the picture.},

  abstract = {A software release is a decision to deliver code to an organization outside of the development team usually for testing or operational purposes. For critical systems this can be a risky decision where failure to pass a test or holding up the project schedule can have a major impact. The release decision is primarily based on the understanding on the level of quality the software currently has (be it high quality, low quality, or unknown). But for large, complex systems, determining the level of quality with high confidence is a challenge. A poor understanding of the confidence in the quality level increases decision risk leading potentially to a bad release decision that possibly could have been avoided had the confidence in the quality been better known. Certification of release readiness attempts to address this risk by building confidence in the quality level. But this comes at a cost and the relationship between certification and decision risk reduction has not been well understood. This work describes our experience investigating the value of certification and our efforts to improve the manyeard software readiness certification record (SRCR) process. A well known critical system at JPL is used as a case study to exemplify this effort.},

  abstract = {Abstract Incremental software development replaces monolithic-type development by offering a series of releases with additive functionality. To create optimal value under existing project constraints, the question is what should be done when? Release planning is giving the answer. It determines proper priorities and assigns features to releases. Comprehensive stakeholder involvement ensures a high degree of applicability of the results. The formal procedure of release planning is able to consider different criteria (urgency, importance) and to bring them together in a balanced way. Release planning is based on (estimates of) the implementation effort. In addition, constraints related to risk, individual resources necessary to implement the proposed features, money, or technological dependencies can be easily adopted into the release planning approach presented in this article. Releases are known to be new versions of an evolving product. However, the idea of a release is not restricted to this, but can be applied to any type of periodic development where a release would correspond to an annual or quarterly time period. The special case of one release called prioritization is of even larger applicability wherever competing items have been selected under additional constraints. An informal and later a formal problem description of the release planning problem is given. Ad hoc or just experience-based planning techniques are not able to accommoyear size, complexity and the high degree of uncertainty of the problem. Plans generated in this way will typically result in unsatisfied customers, time and budget overruns, and a loss in market share. As a consequence of the analysis of the current state-of-the practice, we propose a more advanced approach based on the strengths of intelligent software engineering decision support. Existing release planning methods and tool support are analyzed. An intelligent tool support called ReleasePlanner® is presented. The web-based tool is based on an iterative and evolutionary solution procedure and combines the computational strength of specialized optimization algorithms with the flexibility of intelligent decision support. It helps to generate and evaluate candiyear solutions. As a final result, a small number of most promising alternative release plans are offered to the actual decision-maker. Special emphasis is on facilitating what-if scenarios and on supporting re-planning. Different usage scenarios and a case study project are presented. Practical experience from industrial application of ReleasePlanner® is included as well. Future directions of research are discussed.},

Despite the success of the OSS model, for-profit organizations are having difficulty building a business model around the open source paradigm. Whereas there are some isolated empirical studies, little rigorous research has been done on how traditional organizations can implement and benefit from OSS practices. This research explores how organizations can foster an environment similar to OSS to manage their software development efforts to reap its numerous advantages. Drawing on organizational theory, we develop a framework that guides the creation and management of a hybrid-OSS community within an organization.

In the present research, we focus on how IOS affects reuse. Employing a qualitative case study, we examine the IOS program at IBM called "Community Source." Analyzing data gathered from multiple sources reveals that IOS adoption facilitates participatory reuse by enhancing information sharing and leveraging of broader community skills. Participatory reuse manifests itself when potential reusers participate in the entire development process leading to the creation of reusable assets. Based on data, we develop a theoretical model to illustrate how IOS affects reuse. While furthering research on IOS and reuse, the model informs managers wishing to foster participatory reuse that they are wise to adopt IOS as a vehicle to promote greater openness of the software development infrastructure for leveraging broader community skills and enhancing information sharing among projects' stakeholders.},

Using product software is an everyday phenomenon and product software is a major worldwide industry. Yet, there are very few scientific studies reported on the engineering of product software specifically. In this paper, we discuss specifics of the software business, the various terms used for product software and provide our definition of product software. Moreover, we explain difference between product software and tailor-made software from a software development perspective and provide a new framework for the categorization of product software. This paper points out the urgent need for more research on product software and the directions.},

The physical justification of these concepts and examples are also given. The graph of a pair (A,b) is also defined. This gives another way of describing the structure of this pair. The property of structural controllability is reduced to a property of the graph of the pair (A,b). To do this, the basic concept of a "cactus" and the related concept of a "precactus" are introduced. The main result of this paper states that the pair (A,b) is structurally controllable if an only if the graph of (A,b) is "spanned by a cactus." The result is also expressed in a more conventional way, in terms of some properties of the pair (A,b).},

Considering the different domains of the data sets, we address two questions: (a) to what extent do the collaboration networks reconstructed from the data share common structural features, and (b) can their structure be reproduced by the same agent-based model. In our data-driven modeling approach we use aggregated network data to calibrate the probabilities at which agents establish collaborations with either newcomers or established agents. The model is then valiyeard by its ability to reproduce network features not used for calibration, including distributions of degrees, path lengths, local clustering coefficients and sizes of disconnected components. Emphasis is put on comparing domains, but also sub-domains (economic sectors, scientific specializations). Interpreting the link probabilities as strategies for link formation, we find that in R{\\&}D collaborations newcomers prefer links with established agents, while in co-authorship relations newcomers prefer links with other newcomers. Our results shed new light on the long-standing question about the role of endogenous and exogenous factors (i.e., different information available to the initiator of a collaboration) in network formation.},

However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.},

Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses a major episode in contemporary biomedical research using a new semi-quantitative approach. In the late 1970s, immunologists began producing new kinds of antibodies targeting molecules on the surface of normal and malignant blood cells. These tools quickly transformed biomedical research in immunology and oncology-hematology. Laboratories worldwide produced thousands of these new reagents and reorganized the classification, diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases such as leukemia and the lymphomas. The rapid development of these reagents initially generated considerable confusion. To avoid the impending chaos, researchers in the field, officially supported by the World Health Organization and the International Union of Immunological Societies, launched an ongoing series of distributed workshops that led to the establishment of a nomenclature of antibody reagents and cell surface molecules. The First Workshop (1981-82) mobilized 54 research groups from 14 countries and resulted in the establishment of 15 antibody/molecule categories. By the late 1990s the number of these categories had increased to more than 247 and the number of participating laboratories had risen to more than 500. Sociological analyses of this kind of large-scale collaborative research usually adopt one of two equally unsatisfactory alternatives: either they provide thick descriptions of selected sites, thus missing the figurational dimension of the collaborative network, or they attempt to account for figurational complexity by reducing it to a few quantitative indicators, thus destroying for all practical purposes the very phenomena under investigation. To avoid these two alternatives, we opted for a combination of ethnographic methods (interviews, content analysis) and a computer-based analysis of the more than 6000 antibodies examined during the first six workshops, using Réseau-Lu, a software program specifically designed for the treatment of heterogeneous relational data.},

Recent methods for modeling network data in continuous time model the rate at which individuals interact conditioned on the previous history of events as well as actor covariates. We present a hierarchical extension for modeling multiple such sequences, facilitating inferences about event-level dynamics and their variation across sequences. The hierarchical approach allows one to share information across sequences in a principled manner—we illustrate the efficacy of such sharing through a set of prediction experiments. After discussing methods for adequacy checking and model selection for this class of models, the method is illustrated with an analysis of high school classroom dynamics from 297 sessions.},

Examples of these coordination ties are found in such diverse domains as scientific collaboration, international treaties, and romantic relationships and marriage. This article introduces dynamic network actor models (DyNAM) for the statistical analysis of coordination networks through time. The strength of the models is that they explicitly address five aspects about coordination networks that empirical researchers will typically want to take into account: (1) that observations are dependent, (2) that ties reflect the opportunities and preferences of both actors involved, (3) that the creation of coordination ties is a two-sided process, (4) that data might be available in a time-stamped format, and (5) that processes typically differ between tie creation and dissolution (signed processes), shorter and longer time windows (windowed processes), and initial and repeated creation of ties (weighted processes). Two empirical case studies demonstrate the potential impact of DyNAM models: The first is concerned with the formation of romantic relationships in a high school over 18 months, and the second investigates the formation of international fisheries treaties from 1947 to 2010.},

  abstract = {The capabilities offered by digital communication are leading to the evolution of new network structures that are grounded in communication patterns. As these structures are significant for organizations, much research has been devoted to understanding network dynamics in ongoing processes of electronic communication. A valuable method for this objective is Social Network Analysis. However, its current focus on quantifying and interpreting aggregated static relationship structures suffers from some limitations for the domain of analyzing online communication with high volatility and massive exchange of timed messages. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a method for event-based dynamic network visualization and analysis together with its exploratory social network intelligence software Commetrix. Based on longitudinal data of corporate email communication, the paper demonstrates how exploration of animated graphs combined with measuring temporal network changes identifies measurement artifacts of static network analysis, describes community formation processes and network lifecycles, bridges actor level with network level analysis by analyzing the structural impact of actor activities, and measures how network structures react to external events. The methods and findings improve our understanding of dynamic phenomena in online communication and motivate novel metrics that complement Social Network Analysis.},

For example, the field of software ecosystems is influenced by both natural and business ecosystems, as studies have identified a strong inspiration from both. In this study, we survey the ecosystem literature and identify how different types of ecosystems as much as their aspects appear in a wide literature scope. Using a bibliometric approach, our study reveals a literature body of 2,271 documents published from 1990 onward. Our analysis identifies 11 distinct research communities with one of them focusing on software ecosystems. Furthermore, it also reveals that, although the different communities are rather connected with each other, the software ecosystems community appears as an outlier, with little connections to other communities. When examining the software ecosystem community, consisted of 147 publications, we identify four distinct thematic clusters. We characterize these clusters by their theoretical background and uncover lack of a prevailing theoretical theme. Thus, this study calls for a formation of a research agenda for the software ecosystem field.},

Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) enables one-to-many communication, the relevance of eWOM has increased exponentially. It occurs through discussion forums, blogs, online opinion sites, online communities, online product reviews and comments written by consumers on web pages. According to our view, ratings and review systems differ in terms of how they are controlled by the firms which consequently also impacts the features and effects of realized eWOM. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to investigate the diversity of eWOM, to identify and analyse divergent occurrences of eWOM in-depth, to sort types/mechanisms and develop an integrative typology for divergent mechanisms of eWOM. The empirical part of the study comprises analysis of different known e-commerce websites (e.g. Ebay, Booking.com). The main results of this research are firstly the analysis schema brings in the aspects that differentiates divergent eWOM types (RQ1) and secondly the classification of eWOM mechanisms (RQ2). This paper contributes by showing that eWOM consists of not-controlled electronic word-of-mouth and recommendations and more controlled electronic testimonials and customer references. Thus we will contribute also by clarifying the concept of eWOM.},

Methods Each app was independently coded by two reviewers for its (1) approach to smoking cessation and (2) adherence to the U.S. Public Health Service's 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Each app was also coded for its (3) frequency of downloads. Results Apps identified for smoking cessation were found to have low levels of adherence to key guidelines in the index. Few, if any, apps recommended or linked the user to proven treatments such as pharmacotherapy, counseling, and/or a quitline. Conclusions iPhone apps for smoking cessation rarely adhere to established guidelines for smoking cessation. It is recommended that current apps be revised and future apps be developed around evidence-based practices for smoking cessation.},

  abstract = {Social commerce has taken the e-tailing world by storm. Business-to-consumer sites and, more important, intermediaries that facilitate shopping experience, continue to offer more and more innovative technologies to support social interaction among like-minded community members or friends who share the same shopping interests. Among these technologies, reviews, ratings, and recommendation systems have become some of the most popular social shopping platforms due to their ease of use and simplicity in sharing buying experience and aggregating evaluations. This paper studies the effect of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) communication among a closed community of book readers. We studied the entire market of Amazon Shorts e-books, which are digital microproducts sold at a low and uniform price. With the minimal role of price in the buying decision, social discussion via eWOM becomes a collective signal of reputation, and ultimately a significant demand driver. Our empirical study suggests that eWOM can be used to convey the reputation of the product (e.g., the book), the reputation of the brand (i.e., the author), and the reputation of complementary goods (e.g., books in the same category). Until newer social shopping technologies gain acceptance, eWOM technologies should be considered by both e-tailers and shoppers as the first and perhaps primary source of social buying experience.},

We found the ecosystem model to be very robust as a model to discuss, categorize, and explain the mobile industry in Japan, leading us to a robust and explanatory push-pull investment model. It is intended that this model will be used for future research. We concluded in this research that risk-taking was the predominant factor influencing the success of the mobile ecosystem in Japan. We found in Japan a clear investment earlier in the process, as the first step in most cases, where mobile carriers, such as NTT DoCoMo, would partner with university labs to develop mobile applications, such as i-Mode and e-payment systems, and then mobile consumers would have new applications and functionality to adopt.

Drawing from diverse sources including physical architecture, industrial design, the psychology of perception, and cross-cultural mono-myth, a new implementation paradigm is proposed to help software architects and developers meet these challenges; one that invites participants to shift their mental model from that of programming network devices to programming the network to which those devices are connected. To accomplish this goal an "affordance-rich message" is proposed; one that is based on shared understanding through network-oriented affordances instead of device-oriented APIs. A working model based on this approach is offered, examples given, and areas of related work identified.},

  abstract = {Open source or proprietary strategy? Which is more effective? Which strategy has received more attention from the developers? Which leads to more groundbreaking applications? One can say the open source strategy is more successful due to its innovations and inventions (Paulson et al, 2004) and conversely, one can believe that the proprietary strategy is more successful because it will lead to more qualified applications due to strong governance. The reality, however, is not that black and white, especially when it comes to the software on the smartphones (mobile software platform). Considering a platform as open or closed is rarely a binary decision but is usually a question of “how open? (Maxwell, 2006). The answer to the question is related to the openness strategy of the platform. Openness strategy is the degree to which a platform supplier allows the platform users or developers to interact with the platform, extend or change its components. It depends on different technical, organizational and commercial aspects such as platform architecture, platform accessibility, platform transparency, licensing state, marketing policy, etc. Mobile software platform means the overall structure of the software on the mobile devices (Cho et al, 2007). The openness strategy is different among various mobile software platforms of smartphone ecosystems. A software ecosystem is “a set of actors functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with the relationships among them? (Jansen et al, 2009).},

I present three models of such markets: a monopoly platform; a model of competing platforms where agents join a single platform; and a model of "competitive bottlenecks" where one group joins all platforms. The determinants of equilibrium prices are (i) the magnitude of the cross-group externalities, (ii) whether fees are levied on a lump-sum or per-transaction basis, and (iii) whether agents join one platform or several platforms.},

  abstract = {AbstractContext Traditionally, Embedded Systems (ES) are tightly linked to physical products, and closed both for communication to the surrounding world and to additions or modifications by third parties. New technical solutions are however emerging that allow addition of plug-in software, as well as external communication for both software installation and data exchange. These mechanisms in combination will allow for the construction of Federated Embedded Systems (FES). Expected benefits include the possibility of third-party actors developing add-on functionality; a shorter time to market for new functions; and the ability to upgrade existing products in the field. This will however require not only new technical solutions, but also a transformation of the software ecosystems for ES. Objective This paper aims at providing an initial characterization of the mechanisms that need to be present to make a \{FES\} ecosystem successful. This includes identification of the actors, the possible business models, the effects on product development processes, methods and tools, as well as on the product architecture. Method The research was carried out as an explorative case study based on interviews with 15 senior staff members at 9 companies related to \{ES\} that represent different roles in a future ecosystem for FES. The interview data was analyzed and the findings were mapped according to the Business Model Canvas (BMC). Results The findings from the study describe the main characteristics of a \{FES\} ecosystem, and identify the challenges for future research and practice. Conclusions The case study indicates that new actors exist in the \{FES\} ecosystem compared to a traditional supply chain, and that their roles and relations are redefined. The business models include new revenue streams and services, but also create the need for trade-offs between, e.g., openness and dependability in the architecture, as well as new ways of working.},

However, it is not clear what the implications are on software quality when moving from a traditional approach to an ecosystem, and this is becoming increasingly important as ecosystems emerge in critical domains such as embedded applications. Therefore, this paper investigates the challenges related to quality assurance in software ecosystems, and identifies what approaches have been proposed in the literature. The research method used is a systematic literature mapping, which however only resulted in a small set of six papers. The literature findings are complemented with a constructive approach where areas are identified that merit further research, resulting in a set of research topics that form a research agenda for quality assurance in software ecosystems. The agenda spans the entire system life-cycle, and focuses on challenges particular to an ecosystem setting, which are mainly the results of the interactions across organizational borders, and the dynamic system integration being controlled by the users.},

We ground our study in theories of complex systems, strategy dynamics, and industry life cycle. Using a unique longitudinal dataset, we define and develop graph and information theoretic measures of coopetition, convergence, complexity, and velocity of the ICT ecosystem. We frame the “transformation path” of the ICT ecosystem using these proposed metrics and map the trajectory using complex network visualizations. Our results show that while segments in the ICT ecosystem have converged, the rate of convergence is decreasing. This suggests a growing maturity of the ecosystem and decreasing importance on formal interfirm relationships. At the same time, we find that coopetition is increasing at a decreasing rate. We also find evidence of a declining engagement in interfirm R\&D and a growing number of technology transfer relationships, indicating a possible shift from value exploration to value capturing. Our novel data-based metrics provide a foundation for strategic analysis of new business opportunities that is not possible using traditional market analysis tools.

  abstract = {Existing theory and research on relationships among competitors focuses either on competitive or on cooperative relationships between them, and the one relationship is argued to harm or threaten the other. Little research has considered that two firms can be involved in and benefit from both cooperation and competition simultaneously, and hence that both types of relationships need to be emphasized at the same time. In this article, it is argued that the most complex, but also the most advantageous relationship between competitors, is "coopetition" where two competitors both compete and cooperate with each other. Complexity is due to the fundamentally different and contradictory logics of interaction that competition and cooperation are built on. It is of crucial importance to separate the two different parts of the relationship to manage the complexity and thereby make it possible to benefit from such a relationship. This article uses an explorative case study of two Swedish and one Finnish industries where coopetition is to be found, to develop propositions about how the competitive and cooperative part of the relationship can be divided and managed. It is shown that the two parts can be separated depending on the activities degree of proximity to the customer and on the competitors' access to specific resources. It is also shown that individuals within the firm only can act in accordance with one of the two logics of interaction at a time and hence that either the two parts have to be divided between individuals within the company, or that one part needs to be controlled and regulated by an intermediate actor such as a collective association.},

In contrast, products that are cued more by the environment or are more publicly visible receive more WOM both right away and over time.

The analysis shows that although some developers experience success, financialreturns remain elusive and many encounter intense pressure to generate and market newproducts in a competitive and saturated market. Crowdsourcing allows Apple to effectivelysource development to a global base of software developers, capitalizing on the mass pro-duction of digital products while simultaneously managing to sidestep the incurred costsand responsibilities associated with directly employing a high-tech workforce.},

Nevertheless, likewise to what happens in other mobile segments, business models to put mAR in value are not clearly defined yet. In this paper, we focus on sketching the big picture of the commercial offer of mAR applications, in order to inspire a posterior analysis of business models that may successfully support the evolution of mAR. We have gathered more than 400 mAR applications from Android Market, and analyzed the offer as a whole, taking into account some technology aspects, pricing schemes and user adoption factors. Results show, for example, that application providers are not expecting to generate revenues per direct download, although they are producing high-quality applications, well rated by the users.},

  abstract = {Systems are composed of complementary products (e.g., video game systems are composed of the video game console and video games). Prior literature on indirect network effects has argued that in system markets, sales of the primary product (often referred to as “hardware?) largely depend on the availability of complementary products (often referred to as “software?). Mathematical and empirical analyses have almost exclusively operationalized software availability as software quantity. However, though not substantiated with empirical evidence, case illustrations show that certain high-quality, “superstar? software titles (e.g., Super Mario 64) may have disproportionately large effects on hardware unit sales (e.g., Nintendo N64 console sales). In the context of the U.S. home video game console market, the authors show that the introduction of a superstar increases video game console sales by an average of 14\% (167,000 units) over a period of five months. One in every five buyers of a superstar software title also purchases the hardware required to use the software. Software type does not consistently alter this effect. The findings imply that scholars who study the relationship between software availability and hardware sales need to account for superstar returns and their decaying effect over time, beyond a mere software quantity effect. Hardware firms should maintain a steady flow of superstar introductions because the positive effect of a superstar lasts only five months and, if need be, make side payments to software firms because superstars dramatically increase hardware sales. Hardware firms' exclusivity over superstars does not provide an extra boost to their own sales, but it takes away an opportunity for competing systems to increase their sales.},

To isolate causal effects, I exploit changes in the software labor market. Consistent with past theory, I find a tight link between the number of producers on platform and the number of software varieties that were generated. The patterns indicate the link is closely related to the diversity and distinct specializations of producers. Also highlighting the role of heterogeneity and nonrandom entry and sorting, later cohorts generated less compelling software than earlier cohorts. Adding producers to a platform also shaped investment incentives in ways that were consistent with a tension between network effects and competitive crowding, alternately increasing or decreasing innovation incentives depending on whether apps were differentiated or close substitutes. The crowding of similar apps dominated in this case; the average effect of adding producers on innovation incentives was negative. Overall, adding large numbers of producers led innovation to become more dependent on population-level diversity, variation, and experimentation—while drawing less on the heroic efforts of any one individual innovator.},

Apps (n=204) were coded for adherence to 13 evidence-informed practices for weight control. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of apps based on endorsement practices. Only a small percentage of apps had five or more of the 13 practices (15\%). Latent class analysis revealed three main types of apps: diet, physical activity, and weight journals (19\%); dietary advice and journals (34\%); and weight trackers (46\%). User ratings were not associated with apps from these three classes. Many apps have insufficient evidenceinformed content.

Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to year. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper no\_addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext.

  abstract = {A novel optimisation technique inspired by natural ecosystems is presented, where the optimisation works at two levels: a first optimisation, migration of services which are distributed in a decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this process feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that operates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy locally relevant constraints. Through this two-fold process, the local search is accelerated and will yield better local optima, because the distributed optimisation already provides a good sampling of the search space by making use of computations already performed in other peers with similar constraints. We call this new distributed optimisation architecture a digital ecosystem, an ecosystem-orientated architecture (EOA) created by extending a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with distributed evolutionary computing (DEC). The digital ecosystem will allow services to recombine and evolve over time, constantly seeking to improve their effectiveness for the user base. individuals within our digital ecosystem will be applications (groups of services), created in response to user requests by using evolutionary optimisation to aggregate the services. These individuals will migrate through the digital ecosystem and adapt to find niches where they are useful in fulfilling other user requests},

WOM can be characterized by valence, focus, timing, solicitation and degree of management intervention. Most recent WOM research has been conducted from a customer-to-customer perspective, even though WOM is found in other contexts such as influence, employee and recruitment markets.

There can be no doubt that the development of software ecosystems have caused major players in the software industry to rethink their operating practices and engage with third parties, opening their platforms to external entities to attain business objectives. In this paper we examine four of the organizations that are at the forefront of software ecosystem adoption, specifically for mobile devices and explore their business development models. This investigation explores and compares their business process models in terms of how they engage with the external players in order to develop and distribute software and services in this changing marketplace.

  abstract = {Mining the Web: Discovering Knowledge from Hypertext Data is the first book devoted entirely to techniques for producing knowledge from the vast body of unstructured Web data. Building on an initial survey of infrastructural issues—including Web crawling and indexing—Chakrabarti examines low-level machine learning techniques as they relate specifically to the challenges of Web mining. He then devotes the final part of the book to applications that unite infrastructure and analysis to bring machine learning to bear on systematically acquired and stored data. Here the focus is on results: the strengths and weaknesses of these applications, along with their potential as foundations for further progress. From Chakrabartis work—painstaking, critical, and forward-looking—readers will gain the theoretical and practical understanding they need to contribute to the Web mining effort. * A comprehensive, critical exploration of statistics-based attempts to make sense of Web Mining. * Details the special challenges associated with analyzing unstructured and semi-structured data. * Looks at how classical Information Retrieval techniques have been modified for use with Web data. * Focuses on todays dominant learning methods: clustering and classification, hyperlink analysis, and supervised and semi-supervised learning. * Analyzes current applications for resource discovery and social network analysis. * An excellent way to introduce students to especially vital applications of data mining and machine learning technology.},

  abstract = {Purpose ï¿½ In light of the growth of internet usage and its important role in the field of e-commerce, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has been changing people's behavior and decisions. People count on other users' opinions and information; they sometimes even make offline decisions based on information acquired online. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise eWOM activity from an input-process-output (IPO) perspective; propose a classification framework based on the identified academic literature; analyze eWOM literature in terms of quantitative development and qualitative issues that are useful to both academics and researchers; and provide directions and guidelines for future research studies in eWOM. Design/methodology/approach ï¿½ The authors performed a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed published journal articles and examined the current state of knowledge on eWOM literature based on a comprehensive search of several leading databases. In total, 94 articles were identified that comprised contributions from different strands of eWOM research. The scope of this investigation was limited to the timeframe of 2000-2009. Findings ï¿½ The present study finds that research in eWOM is relatively new and has evolved only during the last ten years. This ten-year study is deemed to be representative of the available eWOM literature. It is also shown that many scholars have incorporated established theories to explain eWOM communication phenomena. The current study not only fills the current gap in eWOM research but also provides a roadmap in analyzing eWOM communications. Practical implications ï¿½ This study serves as a consoliyeard database that may be used to guide future research. It provides a structured approach to analyzing the literature and identifying trends and gaps in order to map out an appropriate agenda for eWOM research. The proposed integrated classification framework can serve as a roadmap for academic research. Originality/value ï¿½ This paper systematically reviews the current state of eWOM research. To contribute to the development of a more comprehensive database for eWOM research, a classification framework of the eWOM literature is presented, building on the IPO model, by summarizing and organizing prior research into three areas covering antecedents, processes, and consequences of eWOM. The authors further summarize the theories and models that previous scholars have applied to their studies.},

Recognizing potential negative impacts of this search cost for quality information and relevant information, firms began to invest in creating a virtual community that enables consumers to share their opinions and experiences to reduce quality uncertainty, and in developing recom- mendation systems that help customers identify goods in which they might have an interest. However, not much is known regarding the effectiveness of these efforts. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impacts of recommendations and consumer feedbacks on sales based on data gathered from Amazon.com. Our results indicate that more recommendations indeed improve sales at Amazon.com; however, consumer ratings are not found to be related to sales. On the other hand, number of consumer reviews is positively associated with sales. We also find that recommendations work better for less-popular books than for more-popular books. This is consistent with the search cost argument: a consumer’s search cost for less-popular books may be higher, and thus they may rely more on recommendations to locate a product of interest.},

We explore the intellectual roots of the concept, offer a working definition and show how the Xerox Corporation arose by employing an effective business model to commercialize a technology rejected by other leading companies of the day. We then show the long shadow that this model cast upon Xerox's later management of selected spin-off companies from Xerox PARC. Xerox evaluated the technical potential of these spin-offs through its own business model, while those spin-offs that became successful did so through evolving business models that came to differ substantially from that of Xerox.

This relatively new form of word-of-mouth communication, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication, has only recently received significant managerial and academic attention. Many academic studies have looked at the effectiveness of positive eWOM communication, examining the process by which eWOM influences consumer purchasing decisions. eWOM behavior is primarily explained from the individual rational perspective that emphasizes a cost and benefit analysis. However, we felt there was a need for an extensive study that examines consumers' motives for eWOM. In this paper, we focus on the factors that drive consumers to spread positive eWOM in online consumer-opinion platforms. Building on the social psychology literature, we identified a number of key motives of consumers' eWOM intention and developed an associated model. We empirically tested the research model with a sample of 203 members of a consumer review community, OpenRice.com. The model explains 69\% of the variance, with reputation, sense of belonging and enjoyment of helping other consumers significantly related to consumers' eWOM intention. The results of this study provide important implications for research and practice.},

  abstract = {Our objective in this paper is to measure the impact (valence, volume, and variance) of national online user reviews on designated market area (DMA)-level local geographic box office performance of movies. We account for three complications with analyses that use national-level aggregate box office data: (i) aggregation across heterogeneous markets (spatial aggregation), (ii) serial correlation as a result of sequential release of movies (endogenous rollout), and (iii) serial correlation as a result of other unobserved components that could affect inferences regarding the impact of user reviews. We use daily box office ticket sales data for 148 movies released in the United States during a 16-month period (out of the 874 movies released) along with user review data from the Yahoo! Movies website. The analysis also controls for other possible box office drivers. Our identification strategy rests on our ability to identify plausible instruments for user ratings by exploiting the sequential release of movies across markets—because user reviews can only come from markets where the movie has previously been released, exogenous variables from previous markets would be appropriate instruments in subsequent markets. In contrast with previous studies that have found that the main driver of box office performance is the volume of reviews, we find that it is the valence that seems to matter and not the volume. Furthermore, ignoring the endogenous rollout decision does not seem to have a big impact on the results from our DMA-level analysis. When we carry out our analysis with aggregated national data, we obtain the same results as those from previous studies, i.e., that volume matters but not the valence. Using various market-level controls in the national data model, we attempt to identify the source of this difference. By conducting our empirical analysis at the DMA level and accounting for prerelease advertising, we can classify DMAs based on their responsiveness to firm-initiated marketing effort (advertising) and consumer-generated marketing (online word of mouth). A unique feature of our study is that it allows marketing managers to assess a DMA's responsiveness along these two dimensions. The substantive insights can help studios and distributors evaluate their future product rollout strategies. Although our empirical analysis is conducted using motion picture industry data, our approach to no\_addressing the endogeneity of reviews is generalizable to other industry settings where products are sequentially rolled out.},

However, few studies have examined the impact of knowledge sharing through electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in the context of SNSs. This paper investigates the relationship among the use of SNSs, users’ social capital, knowledge sharing, and eWOM. The results show that the intensity of use of SNSs is positively related to trust and identification which have a positive effect on eWOM quality. In addition, eWOM quality has a positive effect on knowledge sharing. Female users feel more strongly about eWOM quality when they trust others, or when they perceive that they belong to their SNS community when they use their SNS. Furthermore, female users feel more strongly about knowledge sharing when they perceive that eWOM quality is good. This study provides the theoretical framework of the relationship between eWOM and knowledge sharing on SNSs from the perspective of social capital.

As a result, tying can be welfare-enhancing if multi-homing is allowed, even in cases where its welfare impacts are negative in the absence of multi-homing. The analysis thus can have important implications for recent antitrust cases in industries where multi-homing is prevalent.},

However, the deployment of telemedicine is faced with standards that are hard to use, application-specific data models, and application stove-pipes that inhibit the adoption of telemedical solutions. To which extent can a software ecosystem approach to telemedicine alleviate this? Objective In this article, we define the concept of software ecosystem architecture as the structure(s) of a software ecosystem comprising elements, relations among them, and properties of both. Our objective is to show how this concept can be used (i) in the analysis of existing software ecosystems and (ii) in the design of new software ecosystems. Method We performed a mixed-method study that consisted of a case study and an experiment. For (i), we performed a descriptive, revelatory case study of the Danish telemedicine ecosystem and for (ii), we experimentally designed, implemented, and evaluated the architecture of 4S. Results We contribute in three areas. First, we define the software ecosystem architecture concept that captures organization, business, and software aspects of software ecosystems. Secondly, we apply this concept in our case study and demonstrate that it is a viable concept for software ecosystem analysis. Finally, based on our experiments, we discuss the practice of software engineering for software ecosystems drawn from experience in creating and evolving the 4S telemedicine ecosystem. Conclusion The concept of software ecosystem architecture can be used analytically and constructively in respectively the analysis and design of software ecosystems.},

Based on a unique hand-collected database of 138 innovative start-ups in the region of Flanders, we analyze the knowledge and business ecosystem and the financial support network. We find that the knowledge ecosystem is well structured and concentrated around a number of central actors while the business ecosystem is almost non-existent at the local level. Further, we find that the financial support network is almost 100\% publicly backed and fails to bridge the knowledge and business ecosystem.

When consumers become more informed, firms that provide highly differentiated products should experience higher growth rates than firms with less differentiated offerings. We construct measures of product positioning based on online ratings and find supportive evidence using sales data from the craft beer industry. In particular, we find that the variance of ratings and the strength of the most positive quartile of reviews play a significant role in determining which new products grow fastest in the marketplace.

  abstract = {For years, word-of-mouth (WOM) has been credited with the ability to influence consumer behavior. Studies have shown that consumers trust their social networks and consider them more credible than advertisers and other media sources; therefore, WOM is immeasurably valuable to marketing. Historically, measuring the effects of WOM has been difficult since most has taken place within private social networks. The Internet and social media have now given marketers an opportunity to track and record the newest and possibly most influential form of WOM--electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). This is especially important because, with the Internet, consumers can potentially reach and influence peers on a global scale, making the power eWOM exponentially greater than traditional WOM. Despite its prevalence in the popular press, relatively little empirical research has been done in eWOM, creating a rare case where academia is playing catch-up with practitioners. Accordingly, this study used the conceptual framework of relationship marketing to test several associated hypotheses. Linear regression analysis was employed to measure the impact of eWOM on the sales success of experience goods, specifically, Amazon Kindle books. Results from data (collected daily for twelve weeks) indicated that two eWOM variables have a consistent, positive impact on sales: 1) the number of customer reviews, and 2) the number of Amazon “likes.? The average customer rating was significant four of the twelve weeks but only at a 90\% confidence interval level. One additional eWOM variable, the number of Twitter Followers an author has, significantly impacted sales, but only during the five weeks surrounding the Christmas holiday; perhaps evidence of a “Social Media Holiday Effect.? Interestingly, in the instances where the number of Facebook friends an author has was statistically significant, it showed a significantly negative effect on sales. No evidence was found to support a relationship between sales success and the average author rating, the average similar products rating, the category, or the publisher type.},

Two different models are used to discuss the transition of the application to an ecosystem: one is an adaptation of the Software Supply Network which represents the main actors that interact with the ecosystem, and the other covers the process of creating an application and its evolution to an ecosystem through Business Process Model and Notation.},

  abstract = {The phenomenal growth in the use of cellular phones and, more recently, also of wirelessly enabled Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), is giving rise to yet another revolution in the business world. This revolution is focused on conducting business on the move or mobile commerce (m-Commerce). This trend is fueled by a consumer interest in being able to access business services or to communicate with other consumers anytime and anywhere. It is also motivated by the interest of the business community to extend their reach to customers at all times and at all places. This paper starts by exploring the similarities and differences between m-Commerce and e-Commerce, followed by an overview of the technologies that support m-Commerce and in particular wireless networks, protocols and devices. A value network for m-Commerce is then presented, followed by an overview of different m-Commerce revenue models. A consumer-centric m-Commerce model for analyzing the types of interactions that a typical consumer might be engaged in within a wireless environment is then proposed, followed by an analysis of the various consumer needs and concerns for m-Commerce services/products. Several business applications are then explored in the context of the proposed interaction model. Finally, the necessary business and technological requirements for the ultimate success of these m-Commerce applications are discussed along with some managerial implications.},

Analyses of panel data of 332 new products from Amazon.com over nine months reveal that the valence of reviews and the volume of page views have a stronger effect on search products, whereas the volume of reviews is more important for experience products. The results also show that the volume of reviews has a significant effect on new product sales in the early period and such effect decreases over time. Moreover, the percentage of negative reviews has a greater effect than that of positive reviews, confirming the negativity bias. Thus, marketers need to consider the distinctive influences of various aspects of online reviews when launching new products and devising e-marketing strategies.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the question of sampling (or selection of cases) in qualitative research. Although the literature includes some very useful discussions of qualitative sampling strategies, the question of sampling often seems to receive less attention in methodological discussion than questions of how data is collected or is analysed. Decisions about sampling are likely to be important in many qualitative studies (although it may not be an issue in some research). There are varying accounts of the principles applicable to sampling or case selection. Those who espouse 'theoretical sampling', based on a 'grounded theory' approach, are in some ways opposed to those who promote forms of 'purposive sampling' suitable for research informed by an existing body of social theory. Diversity also results from the many different methods for drawing purposive samples which are applicable to qualitative research. We explore the value of a framework suggested by Miles and Huberman [Miles, M., Huberman,, A., 1994. Qualitative Data Analysis, Sage, London.], to evaluate the sampling strategies employed in three examples of research by the authors. Our examples comprise three studies which respectively involve selection of: 'healing places'; rural places which incorporated national anti-malarial policies; young male interviewees, identified as either chronically ill or disabled. The examples are used to show how in these three studies the (sometimes conflicting) requirements of the different criteria were resolved, as well as the potential and constraints placed on the research by the selection decisions which were made. We also consider how far the criteria Miles and Huberman suggest seem helpful for planning 'sample' selection in qualitative research.},

In the $600 billion software industry it is the business, not the technology, that determines success or failure. This fact -- one that thousands of once glamorous start-ups have unhappily discovered for themselves -- is the well-documented conclusion of this enormously readable and revealing new book by Michael Cusumano, based on nearly twenty years of research and consulting with software producers around the world. Cusumano builds on dozens of personal experiences and case studies to show how issues of strategy and organization are irrevocably linked with those of managing the technology and demonstrates that a thorough understanding of these issues is vital to success. At the heart of the book Cusumano poses seven questions that underpin a three-pronged management framework. He argues that companies must adopt one of three basic business models: become a products company at one end of the strategic spectrum, a services company at the other end, or a hybrid solutions company in between. The author describes the characteristics of the different models, evaluates their strengths and weaknesses, and shows how each is more or less appropriate for different stages in the evolution of a business as well as in good versus bad economic times. Readers will also find invaluable Cusumano's treatment of software development issues ranging from architecture and teams to project management and testing, as well as two chapters devoted to what it takes to create a successful software start-up. Highlights include eight fundamental guidelines for evaluating potential software winners and Cusumano's probing analysis, based on firsthand knowledge, of ten start-ups that have met with varying degrees of success. The Business of Software is timely essential reading for managers, programmers, entrepreneurs, and others who follow the global software industry.},

The Internet at its inception was widely viewed as not suffering from any competition concerns, however in the last ten years, with on the one hand the emergence of major Internet corporations, and on the other the recognition of the Internet as an important trading platform for offline corporations and their subsequent use of the medium, the issue of anticompetitive behaviour by such entities has reared its head. The three instances involving competition concerns that this paper will consider are: the progress of the European Commission’s antitrust investigation into Google for alleged anticompetitive behaviour in the markets for online search and advertising; the situation with Apple’s App Store and the ability of developers to create applications for its devices (i.e. the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch); and the circumstances surrounding the merger between popular blog the Huffington Post and Internet giant AOL and any implications this may have for concentration and media plurality on the Internet. The legal and regulatory responses so far to these scenarios will be examined, along with an analysis of whether there are legitimate competition and regulatory concerns, and the extent to which they are being no\_addressed by the appropriate authorities. Finally, based on this consideration, a determination on whether any further action should be taken to safeguard competition in these parts of the Internet will be made.},

To analyze how value is distributed among the participants, a framework based on theories of firm strategy is applied, and a novel methodology is used to measure value capture in three phone models introduced from 2004 to 2008. The research shows that carriers capture the greatest value (in terms of gross profit) from each handset, followed closely by handset makers, with suppliers a distant third. However, the situation is reversed in terms of operating profit. Carriers shoulder the burden of network installation, maintenance, and upgrading, which absorbs much of the value from their subscription fees. Handset maker nationality, which may also influence supplier choice, is a key determinant of the geographic distribution of value capture. The results are also used to estimate the relationship of handset subsidies to carrier profits, which has been an issue of concern for antitrust authorities in several countries. The analysis shows how the framework can be used to calculate how much service charges might be inflated to cover the subsidies.},

Scientists in engineering contexts and engineers often try to learn from their natural counterparts and solve problems by following approaches in nature. Software engineering (SE) has already exploited many natural phenomena to improve the efficiency of algorithms, tools, models, and processes. For example, evolution and genes serve as the role model for genetic algorithms, where natural selection is applied to computer programs and data (Goldberg 1989). Ant colony optimization has been inspired by ants and their behavior of finding shortest paths from their nest to sources of food (Bilchev and Parmee 1995). Other examples are neural networks, swarm robotics, and bee algorithms. Recent developments and trends in software product line engineering have made us ponder about the term software ecosystems. It is evident that the term was coined to reflect the organization of software vendors, third-party developers, suppliers, and users (Bosch 2009). The name is obviously derived from the archetype natural ecosystem. However, not much work has been reported which compares characteristics of natural and software ecosystems. Several research reports have emphasized the importance of considering software ecosystems from a business perspective (Jansen et al 2009). However, the key questions are how the two kinds of ecosystems can be mapped to each other, and how software ecosystems researchers and practitioners can benefit from insights taken from natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Background: The rapid growth in the use of mobile phone applications (apps) provides the opportunity to increase access to evidence-based mental health care. Objective: Our goal was to systematically review the research evidence supporting the efficacy of mental health apps for mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) for all ages. Methods: A comprehensive literature search (2008-2013) in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, PsycTESTS, Compendex, and Inspec was conducted. We included trials that examined the effects of mental health apps (for depression, anxiety, substance use, sleep disturbances, suicidal behavior, self-harm, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, stress, and gambling) delivered on mobile devices with a pre- to posttest design or compared with a control group. The control group could consist of wait list, treatment-as-usual, or another recognized treatment. Results: In total, 5464 abstracts were identified. Of those, 8 papers describing 5 apps targeting depression, anxiety, and substance abuse met the inclusion criteria. Four apps provided support from a mental health professional. Results showed significant reductions in depression, stress, and substance use. Within-group and between-group intention-to-treat effect sizes ranged from 0.29-2.28 and 0.01-0.48 at posttest and follow-up, respectively. Conclusions: Mental health apps have the potential to be effective and may significantly improve treatment accessibility. However, the majority of apps that are currently available lack scientific evidence about their efficacy. The public needs to be educated on how to identify the few evidence-based mental health apps available in the public domain to year. Further rigorous research is required to develop and test evidence-based programs. Given the small number of studies and participants included in this review, the high risk of bias, and unknown efficacy of long-term follow-up, current findings should be interpreted with caution, pending replication. Two of the 5 evidence-based mental health apps are currently commercially available in app stores.},

The consideration of the endogenous nature of online user reviews significantly changes the analysis. Our result shows that the rating of online user reviews has no significant impact on movies' box office revenues after accounting for the endogeneity, indicating that online user reviews have little persuasive effect on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, we find that box office sales are significantly influenced by the volume of online posting, suggesting the importance of awareness effect. The finding of awareness effect for online user reviews is surprising as online reviews under the analysis are posted to the same website and are not expected to increase product awareness. We attribute the effect to online user reviews as an indicator of the intensity of underlying word-of-mouth that plays a dominant role in driving box office revenues.},

  abstract = {Abstract— Mobile platform owners are faced with a tension. On one hand they foster generativity to enable third parties to innovate compelling services. On the other hand they regulate innovation on their platforms in order to protect their commercial interests. This tension leads to complex interactions between platform owners and third parties as they negotiate the extent and nature of innovation. This paper outlines on-going research that applies structural narrative analysis in order to simplify these complex interactions into sequences of simpler generic generative and controlling actions. It is intended that these simplified structured sequences of actions will facilitate the identification of the mechanisms that explain how platform owners manage innovation and the paradox of control and generativity. The approach to analysis is illustrated using empirical data concerning interactions that have occurred on the Apple iPhone and Google Android platforms. This data is sourced from blogs reporting events in the mobile industry.},

This study explores various aspects relevant to innovation measurement ranging from definitions, measurement frameworks and metrics that have been proposed in literature and used in practice. A systematic literature review followed by an online questionnaire and interviews with practitioners and academics were employed to identify a comprehensive definition of innovation that can be used in software industry. The metrics for the evaluation of determinants, inputs, outputs and performance were also aggregated and categorised. Based on these findings, a conceptual model of the key measurable elements of innovation was constructed from the findings of the systematic review.

  abstract = {Puts forward the strategy of patching wherein companies frequently reorganize their businesses to take advantage of new opportunities. Differentiates patching from traditional corporate reorganization in that: change is proactive, continuous and mostly small scale: the change process is routine and standardized; business module size is carefully controlled; realignments are made over time; information gathering is ongoing and comprehensive; and there is parity of employee compensation throughout. Avers that to patch well organizations should act quickly, develop a couple of options then choose the route to take; prototype the patch within the organization; carefully recruit the unit manager; plan in detail. Quotes brief examples of patching in practice among well-known firms such as Hewlett-Packard. In turbulent markets, businesses and opportunities are constantly falling out of alignment. New technologies and emerging markets create fresh opportunities. Converging markets produce more. And of course, some markets fade. In this landscape of continuous flux, it's more important to build corporate-level strategic processes that enable dynamic repositioning than it is to build any particular defensible position. That's why smart corporate strategists use patching, a process of mapping and remapping business units to create a shifting mix of highly focused, tightly aligned businesses that can respond to changing market opportunities. Patching is not just another name for reorganizing; patchers have a distinctive mindset. Traditional managers see structure as stable; patching managers believe structure is inherently temporary. Traditional managers set corporate strategy first, but patching managers keep the organization focused on the right set of business opportunities and let strategy emerge from individual businesses. Although the focus of patching is flexibility, the process itself follows a pattern. Patching changes are usually small in scale and made frequently. Patching should be done quickly; the emphasis is on getting the patch about right and fixing problems later. Patches should have a test drive before they're formalized but then be tightly scripted after they've been announced. And patching won't work without the right infrastructure: modular business units, fine-grained and complete unit-level metrics, and companywide compensation parity. The authors illustrate how patching works and point out some common stumbling blocks.},

  abstract = {6. Opening platforms: how, when and why? Thomas R. Eisenmann, Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne INTRODUCTION Selecting optimal levels of openness is crucial for firms that create and maintain platforms (Gawer and Cusumano, 2002; West, 2003; Gawer and Henderson, 2007; Boudreau, 2008; Eisenmann, 2008; Parker and Van Alstyne, 2008). Decisions to open a platform entail tradeoffs between adoption and appropriability (West, 2003). Opening a platform can spur adoption by harnessing network effects, reducing users’ concerns about lock-in, and stimulating production of differentiated goods that meet the needs of user segments. At the same time, opening a platform typically reduces users’ switching costs and increases competition among platform providers, making it more difficult for them to appropriate rents from the platform. In this chapter, we review research on factors that motivate managers to open or close mature platforms. We focus on a subset of platforms: those that exploit network effects by mediating transactions between platform users (Eisenmann et al., 2006; Evans et al., 2006; Evans and Schmalensee, 2007). Our inquiry excludes platforms that do not mediate network transactions but instead enable a firm to offer product variety by sharing common components (as with Chrysler’s K-car or Boeing’s 777). A platform is ‘open’ to the extent that: (1) restrictions are not placed on participation in its development, commercialization or use; and (2) any restrictions --- for example, requirements to conform with technical standards or pay licensing fees --- are reasonable and non-discriminatory, that is, they are applied uniformly to all potential platform participants.... -- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — It is crucial for firms that create and maintain platforms to select optimal levels of openness. Decisions to open a platform entail tradeoffs between adoption and appropriability, and opening a platform can spur adoption by harnessing network effects, reducing users' concerns about lock-in, and stimulating production of differentiated goods that meet the needs of user segments. At the same time, opening a platform typically reduces users' switching costs and increases competition among platform providers, making it more difficult for them to appropriate rents from the platform. This paper describes research on factors that motivate managers to open or close mature platforms. Key concepts include: Absent careful definitions, it is not possible to make general statements about the attractiveness of open versus closed platform strategies. Platform openness occurs at multiple levels depending on whether participation is unrestricted at the demand-side user (end-user), supply-side user (application developer), platform provider, or platform sponsor levels. These distinctions in turn give rise to multiple strategies for managing openness. Forces tend to push both proprietary and shared platforms over time toward hybrid governance models typified by central control over platform technology and shared responsibility for serving users. -- AUTHOR ABSTRACT Platform-mediated networks encompass several distinct types of participants, including end users, complementors, platform providers who facilitate users' access to complements, and sponsors who develop platform technologies. Each of these roles can be opened-that is, structured to encourage participation-or closed. This paper reviews factors that motivate decisions to open or close mature platforms. At the platform provider and sponsor levels, these decisions entail: 1) interoperating with established rival platforms; 2) licensing additional platform providers; or 3) broadening sponsorship. With respect to end users and complementors, decisions to open or close a mature platform involve: 1) backward compatibility with prior platform generations; 2) securing exclusive rights to certain complements; or 3) absorbing complements into the core platform. Over time, forces tend to push both proprietary and shared platforms toward hybrid governance models characterized by centralized control over platform technology (i.e., closed sponsorship) and shared responsibility for serving users (i.e., an open provider role).},

  abstract = {Software platforms are the invisible engines that have created, touched, or transformed nearly every major industry for the past quarter century. They power everything from mobile phones and automobile navigation systems to search engines and web portals. They have been the source of enormous value to consumers and helped some entrepreneurs build great fortunes. And they are likely to drive change that will dwarf the business and technology revolution we have seen to this point. Invisible Engines examines the business dynamics and strategies used by firms that recognize the transformative power unleashed by this new revolution--a revolution that will change both new and old industries.The authors argue that in order to understand the successes of software platforms, we must first understand their role as a technological meeting ground where application developers and end users converge. Apple, Microsoft, and Google, for example, charge developers little or nothing for using their platforms and make most of their money from end users; Sony PlayStation and other game consoles, by contrast, subsidize users and make more money from developers, who pay royalties for access to the code they need to write games. More applications attract more users, and more users attract more applications. And more applications and more users lead to more profits.Invisible Engines explores this story through the lens of the companies that have mastered this platform-balancing act. It offers detailed studies of the personal computer, video game console, personal digital assistant, smart mobile phone, and digital media software platform industries, focusing on the business decisions made by industry players to drive profits and stay a step ahead of the competition. Shorter discussions of Internet-based software platforms provide an important glimpse into a future in which the way we buy, pay, watch, listen, learn, and communicate will change forever.

These businesses serve distinct groups of customers who need each other in some way, and the core business of the two-sided platform is to provide a common (real or virtual) meeting place and to facilitate interactions between members of the two distinct customer groups. Platforms play an important role throughout the economy by minimizing transactions costs between entities that can benefit from getting together. In these businesses, pricing and other strategies are strongly affected by the indirect network effects between the two sides of the platform. As a matter of theory, for example, profit-maximizing prices may entail below-cost pricing to one set of customers over the long run and, as a matter of fact, many two-sided platforms charge one side prices that are below marginal cost and are in some cases negative. These and other aspects of two-sided platforms affect almost all aspects of antitrust analysis - from market definition, to the analysis of cartels, single-firm conduct, and efficiencies.

However, there are wide differences in how this concept is defined, characterized, and implemented in the literature. In this article we present a high-level framework for classifying approaches to personalization that delineates fundamental assumptions about personalization in the literature and relates them to strategies for developing personalization systems. The framework consists of 2 parts: (a) a set of perspectives on personalization that guide the design of personalization systems at a general level and (b) a scheme for classifying how personalization can be implemented. The personalization perspectives represent 4 distinct schools of thought on the nature of personalization distilled from the literature of several fields. These perspectives are ideal types and we discuss them in terms of the motivation they supply for personalization, the goals and means of personalization, and the ways in which they conceptualize and model users. The implementation classification scheme is constructed on 3 dimensions of implementation choices. These 3 dimensions pertain to what to personalize (content, interface, functionality, channel), to whom to personalize (individuals or categories of individuals) as well as who does the personalization (implicit or explicit personalization). The personalization perspectives represent particular concepts of personalization that guide general design choices; these choices are implemented via the options described in the implementation classification scheme. The framework contributes to the development of a common theoretical basis for the study of personalization. We discuss implications of the framework for design of personalization systems and future research directions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the mobile content domain as a heterogeneous and fragmented digital ecosystem. Several taxonomies are considered to distinguish between the different segments that compose the mobile content sector. Although they are useful to acknowledge a first level of fragmentation, the most usual classifications are just translations of other industries into the mobile domain and fail to gauge the attributes of mobile content that can drive its evolution. For this reason, an additional taxonomy is introduced which classifies mobile content as ï¿½adaptedï¿½, ï¿½re-purposedï¿½, ï¿½specificï¿½, and ï¿½augmentedï¿½. Heterogeneity in the mobile content domain is considered to derive from several main sources which are explored in the paper: playersï¿½ different origins and cultures, the production-delivery-consumption structure of content businesses, the diversity of content suitable for mobile usage and the diversity of circumstances for this usage. Finally, some conclusions are introduced, summarized in the idea that the concepts presented offer a better foundation to search for the drivers and barriers related to market and social acceptance of mobile content. Its main consequence, in the authorsï¿½ view, is that mobile content success will require a very segmented approach to its usersï¿½ characteristics and circumstances and a continuous process of interaction and learning.},

  abstract = {Context: Open source software (OSS) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are two consoliyeard research areas in software engineering. OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs.},

Value networks involve a larger number of firms, a more complex set of relationships between them, and agreements on a greater number of interface standards than do value chains. Building from this concept of a value network, the paper shows how: (1) agreements on many of these interface standards are enabling connections to be made between the mobile phone and other industries; (2) the resulting products and services often reflect the technological capability of phones and the existing products and services in these ï¿½otherï¿½ industries; (3) each new interface standard requires a new critical mass of users; and (4) a critical mass of users for a new interface standard partly builds from previously created critical masses of users. On a practical level, this paper's analysis adds to a growing list of evidence that the growth in Western mobile Internet markets is nowhere near its potential and that the change from a value chain to a value network requires a different form of standard setting, policy making, and management than are currently used in the mobile phone industry.},

However, neither market provides actual download data, a very useful statistic for both practitioners and researchers. In the past, researchers developed various strategies that allowed them to infer demand from rank data. Almost all of that work is based on an experiment that shifts sales or collaboration with a vendor to get actual sales data. In this research, we present an innovative method to use public data to infer the rank-demand relationship for the paid apps on Apple’s iTunes App Store. We find that the top-ranked paid app for iPhone generates 150 times more downloads compared to the paid app ranked at 200. Similarly, the top paid app on iPad generates 120 times more downloads compared to the paid app ranked at 200.

First, we identify distinct types of platforms. Our analysis of a wide range of industry examples suggests that there are two predominant types of platforms: internal or company-specific platforms, and external or industry-wide platforms. We define internal (company or product) platforms as a set of assets organized in a common structure from which a company can efficiently develop and produce a stream of derivative products. We define external (industry) platforms as products, services, or technologies that act as a foundation upon which external innovators, organized as an innovative business ecosystem, can develop their own complementary products, technologies, or services. Second, we summarize from the literature general propositions on the design, economics, and strategic management of platforms. Third, we review the case of Intel and other examples to illustrate the range of technological, strategic, and business challenges that platform leaders and their competitors face as markets and technologies evolve. Finally, we identify practices associated with effective platform leadership and avenues for future research to deepen our understanding of this important phenomenon and what firms can do to manage platform-related competition and innovation.},

In particular, the ambition to simultaneously control the platform and distribute design capability to users is challenging. While there is an emerging literature on strategy in platform ecosystems, little empirical evidence exists about the series of strategic actions that platform owners conduct to create value in an ecosystem context. Drawing on a strategy-as-process perspective, this paper augments existing platform perspectives by seeking to understand the micro-strategizing of a platform owner. To this end, we report a multiple case study of Apple’s use of application programming interfaces for generating value from the iPhone platform. Our comparative analysis identifies and explores five different micro-strategies that can be enacted proactively or reactively: counteracting, monetizing, resourcing, securing, and sustaining.

To this end, this paper proposes a theoretical model that centres on two drivers behind boundary resources design and use â€“ resourcing and securing â€“ and how these drivers interact in third-party development. We apply the model to a detailed case study of Apple's iPhone platform. Our application of the model not only serves as an illustration of its plausibility but also generates insights about the conflicting goals of third-party development: the maintenance of platform control and the transfer of design capability to third-party developers. We generate four specialised constructs for understanding the actions taken by stakeholders in third-party development: self-resourcing, regulation-based securing, diversity resourcing and sovereignty securing.

  abstract = {As mobile devices become more widespread and powerful, they store more sensitive data, which includes not only users' personal information but also the data collected via sensors throughout the day. When mobile applications have access to this growing amount of sensitive information, they may leak it carelessly or maliciously. Google's Android operating system provides a permissions-based security model that restricts an application's access to the user's private data. Each application statically declares the sensitive data and functionality that it requires in a manifest, which is presented to the user upon installation. However, it is not clear to the user how sensitive data is used once the application is installed. To combat this problem, we present AndroidLeaks, a static analysis framework for automatically finding potential leaks of sensitive information in Android applications on a massive scale. AndroidLeaks drastically reduces the number of applications and the number of traces that a security auditor has to verify manually. We evaluate the efficacy of AndroidLeaks on 24,350 Android applications from several Android markets. AndroidLeaks found 57,299 potential privacy leaks in 7,414 Android applications, out of which we have manually verified that 2,342 applications leak private data including phone information, GPS no\_location, WiFi data, and audio recorded with the microphone. AndroidLeaks examined these applications in 30 hours, which indicates that it is capable of scaling to the increasingly large set of available applications.},

Among them, collaborative development of open source software (OSS) has witnessed an exponential increase in the last two decades. It represents a successful model of software development where communities of developers collaborate on an often voluntary basis, while users and developers of the software systems can submit bug reports and requests for changes, and need to be kept satisfied in order to maintain their involvement in the system. Drawing the analogy with biological ecosystems, collections of OSS projects developed by the same developer community and interacting together can be considered as software ecosystems. While being significantly different, we can observe many similarities between both types of ecosystems. A biological ecosystem is defined as a biological environment consisting of all species living together in a particular area, as well as the physical components of the environment or habitat with which the organisms interact (e.g., air, soil, water and sunlight). A software ecosystem is made up of a coherent collection of software projects (including software and hardware resources) that are developed and evolve together. They constitute an environment in which members of user and developer communities collaborate towards a common goal. Hence, these communities act as a kind of equivalent of a biological species in the sense that, like species, they evolve over time, and interact with other communities in their environment.},

Design/methodology/approach - States that the internet has emerged as a both a source and an outlet for eWOM. Measures economic value as it accrues to the brand owner and loyalty using repurchase intentions and recommendations. Considers the way that customers who engage in eWOM contribute additional value and influence on loyalty intentions. Develops a conceptual model of customer-to-customer (C2C) know-how exchange. Reports on a study set in the internet user forum of a popular software application used in video editing, where users exchange know-how through threaded discussions. Explains that forum members were invited to complete an online survey and offered a summary of the results as an incentive to participate. Findings - Observes that C2C exchange activities had significant effects on the overall value of the firm's offering. Finds that eWOM communication is perceived as a reliable source of information by customers. Suggests that C2C know-how exchange has a direct relationship with loyalty intentions as well as an indirect relationship mediated through the overall value of the firm's offering. Research limitations/implications - Provides empirical evidence of a direct benefit of eWOM for a company that has been overlooked in earlier research. Originality/value - Demonstrates that perceptions of value of a firm's offering is affected by the value received from other customers of the organization.},

Since consumers rely heavily on reviews when selecting applications, we wanted to know what was being written about in reviews. In particular, we wanted to know if users were discussing privacy and security risks of an application, and if not, what were they writing about instead? In our work, we manually analyzed Android users' reviews to see what they write about when reviewing Google Play applications. Overall, only 1\% of our reviews mentioned application permissions. We also found that a small subset of reviews relating to preinstalled applications and applications that requested a user's rating had underlying privacy and security implications. The majority of reviews focused on the quality of applications: people often described an application using an adjective (e.g., "great app" or "horrible"), wrote about its feature/functionality, specifically said if the application worked or not, and/or put their phone or tablet model in the review. We also found that sentiment did influence reviewers' ratings of the applications. In general, the overall star rating of our sample was overwhelmingly positive, suggesting that Google Play is no different from other e-commerce sites.},

I show that a monopoly platform may prefer not to commit to the price it will charge buyers at the same time it announces its seller price if it faces unfavorable seller expectations.

Platforms facing unfavorable expectations face an additional constraint: their prices and first-party content investment need to be such that low zero participation equilibria are eliminated. This additional constraint typically leads them to invest more less in first-party content relative to platforms facing favorable expectations when first-and third-party content are substitutes complements. These results hold with both simultaneous and sequential entry of the two sides. With two competing platforms---incumbent facing favorable expectations and entrant facing unfavorable expectations---and multi-homing on one side of the market, the incumbent always invests weakly more in first-party content relative to the case in which it is a monopolist.},

  abstract = {Social network games (SNGs) are part of the highly evolving marketing and e-commerce channel of social network sites (SNSs). Marketers in SNGs offer economic incentives of game currency or virtual goods in exchange for consumer interactions with ads, often encouraging consumers to forward marketer-generated messages broadly to social networks. This study investigates factors that lead consumers to engage in these marketer-generated electronic word of mouth (eWOM) behaviors. Social factors, and game factors with intrinsic and extrinsic benefits, are studied within extensions of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Survey data from 158 participants who play games on Facebook were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Normative influence positively impacted eWOM behaviors of opinion passing, or forwarding the message, and opinion giving, which is a persuasion attempt. Game enjoyment negatively influenced opinion passing, and economic incentive positively impacted both eWOM behaviors. Opinion passing significantly enhanced attitudes toward advertising, which in turn, positively influenced brand attitudes. Outcomes suggest marketers may increase brand awareness among eWOM senders through campaigns in SNGs, resulting from enhanced positive attitudes toward SNG advertising. However, applicable to SNGs and other games with advertising, marketers must balance appeal of economic incentives with low disruption to play experiences.},

  abstract = {Development and evolution of software products is a challenging endeavor and a significant subfield of software engineering. One of the commonly applied approaches to control and manage this process is software product line engineering (SPLE). There exist a few process frameworks where the development of lines of related software products is basically a sum of two processes: the development of reusable assets and the rapid construction of software applications using predeveloped assets. Agile software development (ASD) is another major paradigm, which also has been widely adopted by the industry over the past decade. SPLE and ASD seek to achieve the same goal i.e. rapid and efficient construction of software. However, the former emphasizes extensive up-front investment in the development of assets for later re-use in contrast to ASD, which emphasizes a reactive approach, avoiding up-front planning and development Even though these two approaches may seem to oppose each other, the industry has lately showed great interest in combining them both, aiming to cover the weaknesses of the one with the strengths of the other. In combination with the overall shift in the software industry from closed systems mindset towards open systems, the uptake of some ASD principles (for example active customer engagement, incremental and iterative development, and open information flows) in product line organizations may contribute to the emergence of more flexible software ecosystems. This thesis presents a longitudinal study of a software product line organization, which has adopted an adapted ASD methodology in an SPLE context and to a large extent has successful in gaining benefits from both approaches, developing towards more open yet controlled processes. Data have been collected over a period of approximately five years following the progression from a strictly waterfall oriented approach, via the adoption of the agile method Evo, up to the current combined agile software product line engineering approach. The following research questions have been no\_addressed in this thesis: RQ1: How can software product line engineering and agile software development be combined? RQ2: How does a software ecosystem shape? The main contributions of this work are: C 1. Through a longitudinal study of a software product line organization we provide detailed insight into an industrial case and how they have changed over time. C 2. We have illustrated some of the details of how SPLE and ASD can be combined in practical terms. We describe the current organization, their product line and their agile software product line engineering process. C 3. We have illustrated how the incorporation of some of the central agile principles has enabled a closer cooperation with external actors. C 4. We have explained the emergence and mode of operation of a software ecosystem, and provided a conceptual model of software ecosystems based on our findings. C 5. We have proposed a theory of software ecosystems, rooted in socio-technical theory and the concept of organizational ecology.},

  abstract = {Software ecosystems is an emerging trend within the software industry, implying a shift from closed organizations and processes towards open structures, where actors external to the software development organization are becoming increasingly involved in development. This forms an ecosystem of organizations that are related through the shared interest in a software product, leading to new opportunities and new challenges to the industry and its organizational environment. To understand why and how this change occurs, we have followed the development of a software product line organization for a period of approximately five years. We have studied their change from a waterfall-like approach, via agile software product line engineering, towards an emerging software ecosystem. We discuss implications for practice, and propose a nascent theory on software ecosystems. We conclude that the observed change has led to an increase in collaboration across (previously closed) organizational borders, and to the development of a shared value consisting of two components: the technology (the product line, as an extensible platform), and the business domain it supports. Opening up both the technical interface of the product and the organizational interfaces are key enablers of such a change.},

We develop an analytical framework which explicitly characterizes this bidirectional rating-utility conversion process with a new concept ï¿½reservation rating.ï¿½ After integrating this conversion process into utility functions, we derive the market equilibrium and show how the changes in consumer rating behavior affect developers and platform owner's profits and how both developers and the platform owner should optimally react to various consumer rating behaviors in terms of the choices of app price, quality level and revenue sharing percentage. We also investigate how consumer rating attitude would impact the social welfare, suggesting consumers' responsibility, in terms of proper rating behavior, to the overall goodness of app community. The rating-dependent utility function further enables us to derive a self-selection mechanism to achieve the separating equilibrium in which high and low cost rate developers choose differentiated revenue sharing percentages.},

An essential characteristic that distinguishes the business ecosystem concept from sectors or supply networks is the explicit modeling of the mutual dependence of the partners: when one partner leaves the network, the value of the network for the others may decline. When a new partner enters the network, the value of the network for all others may rise. Each member of a business ecosystem ultimately shares the fate of the system as a whole. The term Business Ecosystem was coined by Moore (1993) in his Harvard Business Review article “Predators and Prey? and further conceptualized in his book The Death of Competition (1996). Iansiti and Levien (2002; 2004a; 2004b) extended the business ecosystem concept in a working paper, in their Harvard Business Review article “Strategy as Ecology? and in their book The Keystone Advantage. In many high-tech markets, companies do not engage in the competitive battle on their own, but they are part of a coalition of companies around a “platform? technology. A key mechanism here is the presence of network effects. This means that a product becomes more attractive as more customers start using it and as more suppliers offer complementary products and services. The consequence is that competition increasingly takes place on the platform level.},

Current consumer electronics products are built using components from a large variety of specialized firms, whereas previously each product was developed by a single, vertically integrated company. Taking a software development perspective, we analyze the transition in the consumer electronics industry using case studies from digital televisions and mobile phones. We introduce a model consisting of five industry structure types and describe the forces that govern the transition between types and we describe the consequences for software architectures. We conclude that, at this point in time, software supply chains are the dominant industry structure for developing consumer electronics products. This is because the modularization of the architecture is limited, due to the lack of industry-wide standards and because resource constrained devices require variants of supplied software that are optimized for different hardware configurations. Due to these characteristics open ecosystems have not been widely adopted. The model and forces can serve the decision making process for individual companies that consider the transition to a different type of industry structure as well as provide a framework for researchers studying the software-intensive industries.},

The concept is often defined in vague expressions and is being seen more as a broad societal aspiration rather than a specific performance measure of ecosystem management. As such, the paper aims to demystify ecosystem health, that is, to demarcate an accurate and feasible characterisation of the concept. To achieve this aim an examination of the various viewpoints of nature is undertaken. Models of ecosystem health, such as the notions of naturalness, genetic fitness, climax, diversity, stability and keystone species are each considered and subsequently deemed inappropriate, especially when viewing ecosystems as “complex self-organising systems?. Complex self-organising systems are non-linear dynamic systems that have multiple steady states and have emergent and chaotic properties. One model that captures this selforganisation process is Holling’s adaptive cycle. However, when investigating this model it was concluded that there is no means to determining which phase within a system state, or state within a system is ecologically "better". Therefore, ecosystem health cannot be considered in a positive manner established by scientific objectivity. Rather, the concept must be determined in a normative fashion through it is suggested the elicitation of subjective societal values, so to define an optimal management strategy. But, implementing such a strategy is difficult because the changing nature and unpredictability of complex self-organising systems means we cannot focus on "locking-in" ecosystems (or preferences), instead it is argued we must forever adapt to changing ecological conditions.},

Cross-platform development might alleviate this situation. Several cross-platform approaches have emerged, which we classify in a first step. In order to compare concrete cross-platform solutions, we compiled a set of criteria to assess cross-platform development approaches. Based on these criteria, we evaluated Web apps, apps developed with PhoneGap or Titanium Mobile, and – for comparison – natively developed apps. We present our findings as reference tables and generalize our results. Our criteria have proven to be viable for follow-up evaluations. With regard to the approaches, we found PhoneGap viable if very close resemblance to a native look \& feel can be neglected.},

  abstract = {Mobile platforms combine state-of-the-art mobile phones, i.e., smartphones, with innovative operating systems and so-called app stores. App stores are a special kind of search and product market. They allow consumers to search, buy and install apps for their smartphone. These apps are built for a specific operating system and provide additional functionality. App developers use the app store to promote and sell their products. Adoption by consumers and developers depends on the platform as a whole. We introduce the notion of two-sided markets to mobile platforms. Apple’s iPhone and App Store as well as Google’s Android phones and market are described as a practical example. Theories of two-sided markets are reviewed and analyzed for their applicability to the mobile platform scenario. We identify and discuss promising aspects, pitfalls and shortcomings of existing models. Open research questions are revealed. We find that Rochet and Tirole’s model of two-sided markets provides a good match. It explains some of the peculiarities observed. However, as other models, it falls short of comprehensively representing the mobile scenario. Hence, we identify what a comprehensive model needs to provide and outline extensions to existing models. Furthermore, we apply the work of Parker and Van Alstyne to motivate the strategic decisions observed in the mobile market.},

Drawing on findings from research on virtual communities and traditional word-of-mouth literature, a typology for motives of consumer online articulation is developed. Using an online sample of some 2,000 consumers, information on the structure and relevance of the motives of consumers' online articulations is generated. The resulting analysis suggests that consumers' desire for social interaction, desire for economic incentives, their concern for other consumers, and the potential to enhance their own self-worth are the primary factors leading to eWOM behavior. Further, eWOM providers can be grouped based on what motivates their behavior, suggesting that firms may need to develop different strategies for encouraging eWOM behavior among their users.},

This process has also resulted in the rejection of both explicitly and implicitly political apps. This article analyzes Apple’s guidelines and approval process, discusses content-based rejections of apps, and outlines the consequences of this process for developers’ and consumers’ freedom of expression.

The diversity in smart-devices (i.e. smartphones and tablets) and in their hardware features; such as screen-resolution, processing power, etc.; as well as the availability of different mobile operating systems makes the process of mobile application development much complicated. In this work, we analyze few of these cross-platform development frameworks through developing three mobile apps on each of them as well as on the native Android and iOS environments. Moreover, we also performed a user evaluation study on these developed mobile apps to judge how users perceive the same mobile app developed in different frameworks and environments, from the native to the cross-platform environment. Results indicate that these frameworks are good alternative to the native platform implementations but a careful investigation is required before deciding to check whether the target framework supports the needed features in a stable way.},

This dissertation no\_addresses the new challenges faced by mobile application developers in the new ecosystems through empirical methods. By using the theories of two-sided marketsvand business ecosystems as the basis, the thesis assesses monetization and value creation in the market as well as the impact of electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) and developer multihoming--- i. e. contributing for more than one platform---in the ecosystems. The data for the study was collected with web crawling from the three biggest marketplaces: Apple App Store, Google Play and Windows Phone Store. The dissertation consists of six individual articles. The results of the studies show a gap in monetization among the studied applications, while a majority of applications are produced by small or micro-enterprises. The study finds only weak support for the impact of eWOM on the sales of an application in the studied ecosystem. Finally, the study reveals a clear difference in the multi-homing rates between the top application developers and the rest. This has, as discussed in the thesis, an impact on the future market analyses---it seems that the smart device market can sustain several parallel application marketplaces.},

Numerous studies in different disciplines have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of electronic word of mouth communication. Previously, typically small sample studies suggest that positive electronic word of mouth increases sales and that the effects depend on the volume and valence of reviews and ratings. This studys contribution lies in testing the relationship between electronic word of mouth and the sales of applications in a mobile application ecosystem (Google Play) with an extensive dataset (over 260 million customer ratings; 18 months). The results show that higher values of valence of customer ratings correlate statistically significantly with higher sales. The volume of ratings correlates positively with sales in the long term but negatively in the short term. Furthermore, the relationship between electronic word of mouth and sales seems to be more important when the price of the application increases. The findings also underline the importance of the choice of a measurement period in studies.},

Research on mobile application ecosystems has been significantly driven by data that is focused on the visualisation of an ecosystem's dynamics. This is a valuable step towards understanding the nature of the ecosystems, but it is limited in its explanatory power. Thus, a theory-driven approach is needed to understand the overall dynamics of such systems. This study applies a theoretical framework of value creation in e-business in the context of mobile application ecosystems, with a focus on application developers. A qualitative research strategy is employed in testing operationalisation in a sample of developers. The sample comprises 27 application developers from the three leading mobile application ecosystems. The results show that efficiency is the main source of value, products seldom create value through complementarities, and approaches towards lock-in and novelty seem to vary among application developers. The managerial and theoretical implications of such biased value creation in mobile ecosystems are considered.},

  abstract = {Emerged mobile application stores, such as Apple App Store and Google Play, have been seen as challenging marketplaces for software entrepreneurs. Competition is tight as several thousand individual software developers and companies are offering their products on the marketplaces. Furthermore, a majority of applications are offered for free and more complex revenue models such different kinds of Freemium revenue models are becoming the dominant model of business. However, for the longevity of a software ecosystem, the well-being of application providers is crucial. In order to analyse the dynamics of emerged application marketplaces, we have utilized web crawling to gather data from the mobile application stores. The data gathering has been repeated periodically to create a time series of applications available at the selected stores. Our hypothesis for this work-in-progress is that we can identify trends and successful applications for a closer study. These can then be further analysed for recognizing viable practices. The key findings of our initial studies have shown that: 1) Mobile ecosystems have a significant number of applications and application developers, while the number is still increasing. In a seven month time period, from December 2011, the number of applications in the Google Play marketplace had grown with over 27 000 applications. It seems that the number of application continues to grow without a sign of saturation. Theory would, however, suggest that every market has a saturation point. 2) For the mentioned large number of applications, only a very few gather a significant portion of the overall number of downloads. Results from the Google Play suggest, that a small number of core applications are downloaded a significant amount of times. This would suggest that the market is highly concentrated. This is clearly shown by the fact that just over 1 \% of the applications have reached a download count of 500 000 in the Google Play marketplace 3) Some of the most popular applications, the so called keystone applications, are so important for the health of the ecosystem that the ecosystem owners are willing to sacrifice some of their bargaining power in order to get these applications to their ecosystem. 4) The dynamics of the marketplace is, in addition to the increase of applications, shown by the number of applications leaving the marketplace at a given time. Taking an example from the Windows Marketplace, while in between May 2012 and June 2012 the marketplace had over 7500 new applications and nearly 850 applications had left the marketplace. Finally, 5) Multi-homing, i.e. publishing the same products in multiple ecosystems, is a typical pattern for the most popular and downloaded keystone applications.},

  abstract = {Emerging mobile ecosystems have had a clear effect on the software product business. Marketplaces such as Apple App Store and Google Android Market have gathered both existing large software companies and new start-ups. Furthermore, the competition of the ecosystem providers will increase in the near future. In creating a healthy ecosystem, the role of the software developer is significant. In practise, the ecosystems' ability to entice developers to create software products to the ecosystem can be argued to be a major factor driving the competitiveness of the ecosystem. By offering a platform that enables the developers to easily create software products, which can be easily monetized, makes the platform more approachable. In this paper, we investigate an emerging mobile ecosystem, Android Market, its developers and users by gathering the data of 339,861 applications from the marketplace. With the dataset, we study some common assumptions linked to the marketplace. The results show that the direct software sale to the customers is a practical revenue model only for a few developers. The impact of the size of a marketplace is questioned by the results. However, offering a trial and paid version of the application seems to improve the revenue. Furthermore, certain conventional assumptions of users' behaviour do not seem to hold.},

Increasing number of startups and established developers are alike offering their products in different marketplaces such as Android Market and Apple App Store. In this paper, we are studying revenue models used in Android Market. For analysis, we gathered the data of 351,601 applications from their public pages at the marketplace. From these, a random sample of 100 applications was used in a qualitative study of revenue streams. The results indicate that a part of the marketplace can be explained with traditional models but free applications use complex revenue models. Basing on the qualitative analysis, we identified four general business strategy categories for further studies.},

  abstract = {Microsoft's and Wal-Mart's preeminence in modern business has been attributed to any number of factors--from the vision and drive of their founders to the companies' aggressive competitive practices. But the authors maintain that the success realized by these two very different companies is due only partly to the organizations themselves; a bigger factor is the success of the networks of companies with which Microsoft and Wal-Mart do business. Most companies today inhabit ecosystems--loose networks of suppliers, distributors, and outsourcers; makers of related products or services; providers of relevant technology; and other organizations that affect, and are affected by, the creation and delivery of a company's own offering. Despite being increasingly central to modern business, ecosystems are still poorly understood and even more poorly managed. The analogy between business networks and biological ecosystems can aid this understanding by vividly highlighting certain pivotal concepts. The moves that a company makes will, to varying degrees, affect the health of its business network, which in turn will ultimately affect the organization's performance--for ill as well as for good. Because a company, like an individual species in a biological ecosystem, ultimately shares its fate with the network as a whole, smart firms pursue strategies that will benefit everyone. So how can you promote the health and the stability of your own ecosystem, determine your place in it, and develop a strategy to match your role, thereby helping to ensure your company's well-being? It depends on your role--current and potential--within the network. Is your company a niche player, a keystone, or a dominator? The answer to this question may be different for different parts of your business. It may also change as your ecosystem changes. Knowing what to do requires understanding the ecosystem and your organization's role in it.

Many modern ecosystems have communities of practice where knowledge is transferred by collaborative problem solving, sharing of ideas, software components or configurations. In recent years a widely spread medium for communities of practice is the use of online discussion boards. This research proposes a method to analyze the relationship between software releases and activity in a community. This paper explains how software ecosystem Keystone companies can use software product release management to cultivate communities of practice using an illustrative case study. In this case study a comparison is made between two communities in the Android ecosystem. The results show peaks in community activity coinciding with the software releases. The release not only revitalizes the activity of the developers but the heterogeneous community in its entirety.},

Currently, there exists no working operationalization available that can be used to determine the health of open source ecosystems. Health is typically looked at from a project scope, not from an ecosystem scope. Objectives With such an operationalization, stakeholders can make better decisions on whether to invest in an ecosystem: developers can select the healthiest ecosystem to join, keystone organizers can establish which governance techniques are effective, and end-users can select ecosystems that are robust, will live long, and prosper. Method Design research is used to create the health operationalization. The evaluation step is done using four ecosystem health projects from literature. Results The Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization is provided, which establishes the health of a complete software ecosystem, using the data from collections of open source projects that belong to the ecosystem. Conclusion The groundwork is done, by providing a summary of research challenges, for more research in ecosystem health. With the operationalization in hand, researchers no longer need to start from scratch when researching open source ecosystems’ health.},

  abstract = {Software producing organizations are frequently judged by others for being 'open' or 'closed', where a more 'closed' organization is seen as being detrimental to its software ecosystem. These qualifications can harm the reputation of these companies, for they are deemed to promote vendor lock-in, use closed data formats, and are seen as using intellectual property laws to harm others. These judgements, however, are frequently based on speculation and the need arises for a method to establish openness of an organization, such that decisions are no longer based on prejudices, but on an objective assessment of the practices of a software producing organization. In this article the open software enterprise model is presented that enables one to establish the degree of openness of a software producing organization. The model has been evaluated in five interviews, is illustrated using three case studies, and shows that organizational openness and transparency are complex variables, that should not be determined based on belief or prejudice. Furthermore, the model can be used by software producing organizations as a reference for further opening up their business, to stimulate the surrounding software ecosystem, and further their business goals.},

Unfortunately, no tools are available for these observers to establish how open an organization and the software products it produces really are, leading to detrimental judgements based on speculation rather than a fair comparison. This chapter provides an overview of the different openness options that software producing organizations have available to them. Furthermore, an objective measurement instrument is provided that enables external observers to make a fair judgement on the openness or closed-ness of an organization, which is applied to four case studies to illustrate its application. The Open Software Enterprise model and the measurement instrument illustrate that organizational openness and transparency are complex variables, which should not be established based on belief or prejudice. Software Producing Organizations (SPOs) have one goal in common: get the software that is being produced to be adopted as frequently as possible. Different business models exist to obtain that goal, from open source models where source code is given away for free, to service models where the source code is running on a protected server. SPOs have discovered that they can achieve their goals quicker by creating an ecosystem of partners around the product, such as developers or resellers.},

Getting third parties to follow quality criteria, adhere to platform standards and strategy, and getting them to provide effective and usable extensions can be considered one of the most challenging problems in platform management. Especially in a world where platforms develop rapidly and increasing numbers of niche players want to participate in these ecosystems, it becomes almost impossible to make any guarantees about the quality experience of the end-user. Platform coordinators are in need of an overview of methods to uphold quality standards and ensure that customers reap only the benefits of extensions. In this chapter three methods (review, certification, and community based reviews) and 11 techniques are extracted from 27 case studies to achieve quality goals in a software ecosystem. Furthermore, an overview is provided of how a review team can be composed to improve specific quality aspects. Finally, several review technique improvements are proposed. The methods presented in this chapter provide software ecosystem and platform coordinators with a set of methods for quality management. This enables them to select an optimal set of quality management methods and techniques to guard quality levels in a software ecosystem in a scalable manner. Software platform coordinators who coordinate contributions in the form of extensions and apps from third parties are constantly challenged to maintain quality in their ecosystem.},

  abstract = {While in the early days of software engineering a software product was the result of effort of an independent software vendor to create a monolithic product, modern software strongly relies on components and infrastructure from third-party vendors or open source suppliers (Cusumano, 2004; Sawyer, 2000; Carmel, 1995). The relationships between software development firms and service companies shaped the product software landscape into software ecosystems, where suppliers and buyers of software products, components and technologies collaboratively create competitive value. One could state that the success of a product software company therefore no longer depends only on its own development quality but also on the way it manages its relationships (Gao and Iyer, 2006; Iyer et al, 2006; Farbey and Finkelstein, 2001). Software differs from physical goods in several ways. Software has no physical limitation, therefore the main limitations are conceptual, social and economic (Beizer, 2000; Messerschmitt and Szyperski, 2003). No other business has a gross profit margin of 99 percent on sold products (Cusumano, 2004). In other words, reproduction costs for software products are next to zero. Just as participants in a value chain of physical products, partners in a software value chain maintain ongoing business relationships. Up to the late 1980s, vertically integrated companies delivered complete system stacks (Cusumano, 2004).},

In this paper we study what possibilities and challenges the two-sided application store market brings to the intermediary's (e.g., operator's) business and how these affect the market dynamism. Theoretically, we draw from the literature of two-sided markets, software platforms and intermediaries, observe the emergence of application stores and competition between them with real-world examples and conclude with the representation of the central issues in lowering the barriers to entry from the operators' point of view in order to grasp the arising opportunity.},

Context is key in the mobile space and so too are proactive services that ease user input and facilitate effective interaction. We believe that to enable truly novel mobile app recommendation and discovery, we need to support real context-aware recommendation that utilizes the diverse range of implicit mobile data available in a fast and scalable manner. In this paper we introduce the Djinn model, a novel context-aware collaborative filtering algorithm for implicit feedback data that is based on tensor factorization. We evaluate our approach using a dataset from an Android mobile app recommendation service called appazaar. Our results show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods.},

During the last two years, we have also witnessed the phenomenal success of Apple’s App Store for which people produce the applications and can also create business of them. While the technologies and business services related to these phenomena have been studied separately, we suggest that the underlying digital ecosystem that ties them together has not been made explicit. In this paper, we provide a conceptual model of a digital ecosystem for understanding how companies can co-create business with people. To construct such a model, we use multiple case study approach and explore two cases: an ecosystem around smart phone application market App Store and an ecosystem around bioinformatics service registry BioCatalogue. Our results suggest that the required technical solutions and business services are now available. However, to make business flourish, the orchestration of the overall ecosystem is also essential and needs to be taken care of.},

  abstract = {Highlights We asked experts to assess competition and collaboration among mobiles ecosystems. We propose a novel analysis method utilizing weighted and abstracted networks. Apple’s iOS strategy is the most competition oriented and least collaborative. Google Android is coopetition oriented showing strong competition and collaboration. Microsoft Windows Phone is establishing itself somewhere between Apple and Google. Abstract During the last 5 years, we have witnessed extraordinary development in the mobile market. Apple’s launch of the iOS platform and associated App Store marketplace turned the market around, and Apple became the leading company in the business. This development caused existing players, such as Nokia, to renew their business and attracted new players, such as Google and Microsoft, to enter the market and introduce their own mobile platforms. To understand this development, we suggest that a generic abstracted model of the ecosystem around mobile platforms should be developed describing how the actors, including users, individual app developers, companies, and digital services, are connected and interact. In this work, we propose that competition and collaboration in this kind of abstracted ecosystem can be modeled and analyzed using network analysis. In our research, we derived weighted competition and collaboration networks for each mobile platform from an expert survey, and by calculating companies’ degree centrality in their networks at different times we were able to illustrate how companies’ strategies to build and maintain an ecosystem differ and develop over time. We believe that this kind of analysis is useful both for companies that build ecosystems and also for companies that plan to do business in them. The former can use it to compare their strategy with existing competitors and also evaluate emerging new ecosystems and the latter to compare and choose between possible ecosystems with which to do business.},

The interdependencies of customers, platforms and developers require consideration of strategic issues not present in traditional models. These issues may pertain to all development phases, including platform design, launch and competition and thus, have an effect on existing and new business models in this sector. Economics literature on two-sided markets focuses on theoretical analysis, paying not much attention to managerial implications. Strategic management literature, on the other hand, rather provides practical guidelines. Within this paper, we discuss strategic issues arising in the app platform industry, combining these streams of literature.

In the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. Furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. The authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. The authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. Furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. These findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.},

However, the advertisements on the free versions are increasingly pressuring consumers to purchase the premium version of the product and more often make customers leave the Web site. \textasciitilde \textasciitilde \textasciitilde \textasciitilde \textasciitilde \textasciitilde \textasciitilde \textasciitilde{} 'Freemium' model for apps may not be best bet for a brand's image As a web business model, it's hard to get hotter than "freemium," the catchall term coined by venture capitalist Fred Wilson a few years ago. Myriad web and mobile apps have embraced the concept, offering a free, ad-supported version of a product or service, and a paid, premium version. Casual customers can try out the offering before deciding to open their wallets; advertisers get the implicit value associated with underwriting content or services. But lately it seems like the ads are becoming part of the wrong kind of inducement; that is, to drive consumers away. It's the flip side of freemium: ads not there to persuade, but to annoy users enough to convince them to pay. "Don't like the ads? Upgrade to Premium now," suggests Trivial Technology to users of its "lite" iPhone backgammon app, hoping they'll shell out for the $1.99 premium version. A similar pitch is on offer at Pandora: "No ads: Pandora One is completely free of any sort of advertising: no audio ads, no visual ads. It's just you and your music." And it's the first selling point for the Weather Channel's $3.99 "Max" version of its iPhone app: "Complete weather coverage in an ad-free environment!" That's just the tip of a freemium iceberg that also includes TwitterFon, SMS service Pinger, Tapulous' Tap Tap Revenge game, Android financial app Funky Expenses, Last.fm, Grooveshark and Spotify. The hybrid model is a hedge on both a weak ad market and the consumer's well-established reluctance to pay for anything online. And some app makers say giving up advertising revenue on a premium version is an easy decision: there simply isn't much revenue there in the first place, and since the number of paid subscribers tends to be low, they're not adding much to the scale for advertisers anyway. Take EverNote, a company that allows you to upload and stuff, as well as sync across many computers. EverNote's free ad-supported service, with 1.5 million users, provides just 15\% of the company's revenue; the vast majority is provided by the 30,000 users that pay $5 a month or $45 a year for an upgrade. A message reminds users whenever they close an ad that they can upgrade to an ad-free version. "Certainly, one of the reasons people upgrade is to get rid of the ads," said VP-Marketing Andrew Sinkov. Al Sutton, developer of Funky Expenses, said he'd love to dump advertising altogether but the ethos among Android users is that apps should be free. "It's the kind of thing we could kill tomorrow and not really notice a revenue difference," he said of his mobile ad revenue. Now, generally ad-free isn't the only inducement to upgrade. Evernote offers more storage and features, for example. Pinger allows paying users to send unlimited SMS messages, instead of a cap of 15. But what happens when the ads themselves become a negative inducement-a form of punishment for users unwilling or unable to pay for the premium version? Online and mobile ads are already maligned for sorry targeting and bad creative and the fact that freemium models are counting on an "annoyance factor" isn't likely to help that case. "Advertising in general is annoying and intrusive when it is not relevant," said Chris Cunningham, CEO of Appsavvy. "A lot of mobile ad networks have completely dropped the ball and let CPMs fall far below what they're worth." AdMob general manager Jason Spero said his network delivers higher CPMs than typical web ads. "The data shows when users are offered the choice they prefer to consume ads when tastefully done, and not pay," Mr. Spero said. "If 80\% to 90\% of your users are never going to pay, advertising is the way to monetize." Half of iPhone users buy an app at least once a month, according to AdMob. It's hard to say how many do so to avoid ads vs. adding more features, but there are opinions. "People will pay to open up new features, save time or for services that make them money. But they have been very reticent to pay just to eliminate advertising," said Michael Lazerow, CEO of Buddy Media. And advertising done right can even ad value. Take the house ads on Twitter, which are usually useful tips for using the site. Evernote recently dumped its ad network and started curating its own ads, making usefulness to users rather than revenue as its main gauge for what it runs. It allowed premium users to turn the ads back on and something very weird happened-many of them did. It goes to show when ads are done right, ad-free need not be the sales pitch for "freemium." "We originally thought everyone would turn off the ads, but now we're seeing users who are premium turning ads back on," said EverNote CEO Phil Libin. "It's surprising because you don't need to."

We use crosssectionaldata on the most downloaded application rankings in the Apple App Store to examine the impact of app portfoliostrategy on sales performance. We find that app portfolio diversification is positively correlated with sales performance. Wealso find that sellers who offer a combination of free and paid apps have higher sales performance than those who deliverpaid apps only. Furthermore, the results show that sellers with scale advantages compete differently from sellers in the longtail. These findings have implications for theorizing about product portfolio management in the emerging mobile app storemarkets.},

As customers refer to eWOM to evaluate products, and each product type entails a different scheme of evaluation standards, the impact of eWOM may differ by product type. Thus, we propose a new type of product categorization based on evaluation standard objectivity and hypothesize that this categorization gradually differentiates sales distribution patterns, some of which refute the long tail phenomenon. To valiyear the hypothesis, we collect data from Amazon.com, compare the distribution of eWOM among various product types, and conduct the Wilcoxon signed rank test for statistical significance. All the test results show adequate levels of significance; thus, the three hypotheses are supported. This study sheds new light on eWOM research by developing a new approach to product categorization and by proposing a different use of eWOM in searching for products to explain the different effects of eWOM on sales distribution.},

Selling virtual goods for real money is an increasingly common revenue model not only for online games and virtual worlds, but for social networking sites and other mainstream online services as well. What drives consumer spending on virtual items is an increasingly relevant question, but little research has been devoted to the topic so far. Previous literature suggests that demand for virtual items is based on the items' ability to confer gameplay advantages on one hand, and on the items' decorative value on the other hand. In this paper, I adopt a perspective from the sociology of consumption and analyse examples from 14 virtual asset platforms to suggest a more detailed set of item attributes that drive virtual item purchase decisions, consisting of functional, hedonic and social attributes.},

This has resulted in a plethora of academic contributions on the design of new business models and service platform architectures. However, a discussion of the challenges that operators are facing in adopting these models is lacking. We assess these challenges by considering the mobile network as part of the value system of the content industry. We will argue that from the perspective of a content provider the mobile network is ``just another'' distribution channel. Strategic options available for the mobile communication operators are to deliver an excellent distribution channel for content delivery or to move upwards in the value chain by becoming a content aggregator. To become a mobile content aggregator operators will have to develop or acquire complementary resources and capabilities. Whether this strategic option is sustainable remains open.},

Two new concepts about core capabilities are explored here. First, while core capabilities are traditionally treated as clusters of distinct technical systems, skills, and managerial systems, these dimensions of capabilities are deeply rooted in values, which constitute an often overlooked but critical fourth dimension. Second, traditional core capabilities have a down side that inhibits innovation, here called core rigidities. Managers of new product and process development projects thus face a paradox: how to take advantage of core capabilities without being hampered by their dysfunctional flip side. Such projects play an important role in emerging strategies by highlighting the need for change and leading the way. Twenty case studies of new product and process development projects in five firms provide illustrative data.},

  abstract = {The telecommunications industry is undergoing a radical transformation, creating exciting new opportunities and new challenges for infrastructure and service providers. The established value chain is increasingly being deconstructed, with the entry of powerful new players and radical restructuring of the industry. Rapid technological developments and increasing market turbulences have added new dimensions to an already complex scenario. Many tested business models, as well as related frameworks, tools and techniques, have become obsolete. The paper uses recent evidence to illustrate the evolving telecommunications value chains and market structure, examine the underlying theoretical and practical reasons for such changes, and highlight the strategic implications for the various players involved. The paper concludes that some of the current changes in the telecommunications industry are very radical, and all players need to re-evaluate their strategies and market positions and make hard decisions as to where to go next. The value chains are rapidly evolving into value networks, with multiple entry and exit points, creating enormous complexity for all the players involved. Further research is urgently needed to map out the telecommunications value chains and value networks that are possible in the context of the new economy; identify the different players and the possible strategies and business models that they can adopt; develop new conceptual frameworks for understanding the current changes in the telecommunications and related industries; and create new tools and techniques for identifying opportunities and threats and for making new strategies.},

To no\_address this gap, we empirically examine the relationship between the size and diversity of mobile developers’ app portfolio and their performance in a mobile platform. Using a data set from the Apple App Store, and based on panel-level linear model estimation, we find a negative impact of app portfolio diversity on developers’ performance. However, this impact decreases with portfolio size. This result implies that a diversified app portfolio hinders developers from fostering core competency, whereas their increasing development experience could mitigate this negative effect. Our results provide mobile app developers with a strategic growth trajectory recommendation, i.e., focus on product specialization during the early growth phases but adopt a diversification strategy after the accumulation of substantial development experience.},

Looking more deeply, how does a complex app ecosystem perform when developers choose to use different strategies? This paper investigates these questions using AppEco, the first Artificial Life model of mobile application ecosystems. In AppEco, developer agents build and upload apps to the app store; user agents browse the store and download the apps. A distinguishing feature of AppEco is the explicit modelling of apps as artefacts. In this work we use AppEco to simulate Apple's iOS app ecosystem and investigate common developer strategies, evaluating them in terms of downloads received, app diversity, and adoption rate.},

By analyzing a large panel dataset consisting of 1,597 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales volume and revenue of the paid apps. Higher sales rank and review rating of the free version of a mobile app both lead to higher sales rank of its paid version. However, only higher review rating of the free app contributes to higher revenue from the paid version, suggesting that although offering a free version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, revenue is largely determined by product quality, not product visibility. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is not significant when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app.},

@book{Luo2004,
  abstract = {This book explains coopetition - a new perspective of international business that no\_addresses the simultaneous cooperation and competition between MNE units and their global stakeholders such as global competitors, foreign governments, corporate members, alliance partners, and foreign suppliers. Coopetition explores a new way of looking at business, which leverages complimentary relationships between organizations. It looks for win-win scenarios in which a business strives to get a bigger piece of the pie not by taking share from a contender, but by making the pie bigger. Coopetition is attributed to increasing interdependence between global players and heightened needs for collective actions, risk sharing, strategic flexibility, and prompt response to market demands. MNEs and their business stakeholders mutually depend on each other and yet they have both cooperative and competitive aims underlying their interdependence. Cooperative aims can nourish joint payoff creation through exploiting complementary resources cooperatively. Meanwhile, competitive aims can breed conflicts that may emerge when either party emphasizes its own gains from specific projects in which respective needs are not compatible. Competitive aims always exist because of the underlying incentive for any party to share a higher percentage of returns generated from cooperation. The simultaneity of cooperation and competition arises because MNE units have both private goals and common goals as they deal with outside stakeholders such as rivals, regulators, partners, and suppliers as well as inside corporate members. Thus, under the coopetition scheme, MNE units and their business stakeholders work together to collectively enhance performance by sharing complementary resources and committing to common task goals in some specific areas. Meanwhile, they compete by taking independent action in other areas to improve their own performance. The coopetition perspective portrays the relationship between an MNE and its international business stakeholders as a simultaneous, inclusive interdependence containing cooperation and competition as two separate yet interrelated continua. The interdependence entails competing and collaborating elements, with contending as well as collaborative aims in the course of competitive collaborations. This book illustrates why and how MNE units simultaneously cooperate and compete with global rivals (Chapter 1), foreign governments (Chapter 2), alliance partners and foreign suppliers (Chapter 3), and corporate members (Chapter 4). In each of these chapters, I defined coopetition, explained why coopetition occurs, eluciyeard various aspects in which two players compete and cooperate, and discussed internal and external conditions under which cooperation or competition may increase or decrease. In addition, this book offered a typology that characterizes different MNEs or different situations for the same company. Firms with differing identities under each typology will find different strategies to respond to their unique needs or unique market parameters. Moreover, this book provided specific strategic tactics in response to varying coopetition situations for each type of MNEs. These strategic tactics, policies, and approaches are problem-solving solutions needed by global companies in pursuit of maximum possible returns from coopetition. Finally, this book provided case examples that illustrate simultaneous competition and cooperation with different global stakeholders.},

  abstract = {It's easy to shrug off the kooky world of apps. The bite-size software programs people load onto their mobile phones or tap into on the Web seem mostly to be silly games and pointless novelties. But look past the beer-drinking apps and flatulence programs and you'll see something significant taking shape: a bustling app economy that's creating new fortunes for entrepreneurs and changing the way business gets done. It's happening with dizzying speed. Just two years ago, almost none of this existed. Apple's (AAPL) App Store, the most popular destination for mobile-phone programs, was launched last summer. Now there are more than a dozen rival stores, and at least 100,000 apps have been created. Some startups that staked their claim in the app economy have become large, lucrative businesses in just a few months. Two-year-old Zynga, which makes popular game apps, is already profitable, with more than $100 million in revenues. By comparison, Google (GOOG) didn't start making money until its third year—and still had less revenue. There are serious business tools among the thousands of new apps. Salesforce.com's (CRM) programs let executives manage customer relationships from an iPhone or BlackBerry. Oracle (ORCL) apps let managers check inventory or get a snapshot of a business unit's performance. The computing that people used to do at their desks increasingly can be done on devices they can carry anywhere. Early DaysApps will help determine technology's next big winners. The success of Apple's iPhone is due in large part to the fact that the company can offer customers more software choices than any rival. Research In Motion (RIMM), maker of the business-oriented BlackBerry, has scrambled to catch up and has made progress. But established giants such as Nokia (NOK) and Microsoft (MSFT) are struggling to get traction, raising questions about their prospects. These are such early days, no one knows exactly how big the app economy is. Companies make money from selling apps, from ads within apps, and from selling digital goods used in apps. Add it up and analysts figure it's at least a $1 billion market today, headed for $4 billion by 2012. Not bad for a brand-new business. True, much of the money these days comes from goofy games. One popular app is I Am T-Pain, named after the performer, born Faheem Najm. Fans can download software to their iPhone and mimic his robot-like voice. But it's time to heed the opportunities in this fast-evolving world. The $2.99 T-Pain app has put its creator, a year-old startup called Smule, on track to pull in $3 million this year. "Apps have moved into the mainstream. The world's changed," says Jeff Smith, Smule's chief executive. Zynga's ZingRevenues are soaring on the success of 'Social Game' Apps like FarmVille Early this year, Mark Pincus, founder of the tech startup Zynga, huddled with staffers in his company's San Francisco offices to brainstorm new product ideas. Zynga develops game apps that can be played on social networks such as Facebook or mobile phones like the iPhone, and Pincus needed a follow-up to a popular poker app. One employee suggested a farming game, where players could grow digital crops and sell them to make virtual money. Pincus liked the idea and gave it the green light. Four months after its launch, FarmVille is one of the most popular apps in the world, with 60 million people playing it in the last month. "It just exploded," says Pincus. Such is the nature of business in the burgeoning app economy. Success—and a flood of money—can arrive practically overnight. Zynga doesn't charge users to play FarmVille, but it does sell digital crops, cattle, and farmland. Corn seed, for instance, goes for the equivalent of 10 cents; cows run 20 cents each. All those digital goods add up. Zynga pulls in its nine-figure annual revenues from FarmVille and 20 other games. The company may be just getting started. U.S. revenues from so-called social games have surged over the past two years to $720 million, and analysts project they will grow to $2 billion by 2012. "We are seeing very strong success with these companies," says Atul Bagga, an analyst with investment bank ThinkEquity. "They are basically letting customers choose [how much money] they want to [spend] in a particular game or application." Zynga has the vibe of a young Google (GOOG). Just like the search giant in its early days, the company has a masseuse on staff and chefs who serve up two meals a day to keep employees from wasting time going out for food. It has weekly keg parties, like the ones Google's founders once hosted. And Pincus has tried to maintain a light atmosphere, even as the company has grown to 468 employees. The winner of a monthly poker tournament gets treated to a one-day Lamborghini rental. Pincus calls the atmosphere "ghetto Google." Seeds of SuccessThe company's offices are in the industrial Potrero Hill neighborhood of San Francisco. On a recent October day the 43-year-old Pincus, clad in jeans and an untucked oxford shirt, drew three intersecting circles on a whiteboard. He says the next great opportunity on the Web lies at the intersection of three trends—apps, Web services, and small online payments from consumers. Pincus sees apps not as products but as ongoing services that users tap into from Facebook or the iPhone and pay for in small increments. "Our story has been about finding games people could play forever and giving them a reason to do it," he says. The strategy is in full swing in the FarmVille studio at Zynga, where a 30-person crew manages the company's biggest hit to year. The game is an odd success for the digital world: Users get a virtual plot of land to farm as they see fit. As they grow crops and earn currency, they can use the money to buy more seeds, animals, and tools like tractors. Since all players are logged in to Facebook, they can work with friends or co-workers, or they can compete against them for farmer bragging rights. There are roughly 20 times more people playing FarmVille these days than there are actual farms in the U.S. For a hit like FarmVille, the work is never done. A wall-size chart in the FarmVille studio lists the various virtual items up for consideration in the next round of improvements to the game, culled from staff ideas and requests from users. The ability to get feedback and act on it quickly is a break from past models, says Mark Skaggs, who runs the FarmVille group. At large companies such as Electronic Arts (ERTS), where Skaggs used to work, "You might design a feature and not know until two years later whether it was good or people liked it," he says. "Here, you can design a feature in a day and put it in the game the next day." As Zynga's games have grown, they've become giant test labs for new ideas. "Every single click is being recorded," says Vish Makhijani, Zynga's chief operating officer. That means Zynga can quickly find out the impact of small adjustments—such as changing the size of a cabbage patch in FarmVille or the cost of a new gun in the game Mafia Wars—on retaining users and increasing revenue. One recent success: digital sweet potato seeds that cost $5 a packet. The seeds, which of course cost nothing to duplicate, pulled in more than $400,000 in three days. The rich opportunity has fueled aggressive competition. Zynga's primary rivals are London's Playfish and Mountain View (Calif.)-based Playdom. Playfish is known for a game called Pet Society, which lets people adopt online creatures and then dress them up in designer clothes, while Playdom's hit game is Mobsters, in which people try to gain skills, alliances, and wealth. All three companies are private and don't disclose financial information. The game makers compete for users across all sorts of technology platforms. The big targets are Facebook, with more than 300 million members, and Apple's App Store, with more than 50 million iPhone and iPod touch users. Lately, Playdom and Zynga have also been dueling in court. A lawsuit filed by Zynga in September alleges that several former employees recruited by Playdom supplied the competitor with the Zynga Playbook, a proprietary document the complaint describes as "the recipe book that contains Zynga's 'secret sauce,'" referring to its game-making techniques. The rapid growth and sharp rivalries have drawn comparisons to the early days of Web pioneers such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY). One significant difference is that the apps business has virtually no barriers to entry, meaning it is hard for any company to maintain a lead. Today there are thousands of small developers who crank out apps that don't make a dime. The perk-heavy culture at Zynga is certainly reminiscent of the dot-com days. Inside its office for human resources, 160 small paper bulldogs are tacked on the wall, one for every new hire in the past quarter. There's a cooking staff of 17, and most game studios have their own kitchen. Several rooms are equipped with Xboxes and board games, and are designated "meeting-free areas." New Staffers and a CouchWith employees grouped into a series of discrete loft offices, Zynga's operation looks more like 11 small startups glued together than one large one. It's a reflection of how the company is run: Studio heads set goals and are given freedom to achieve them any way they can. Those who succeed are rewarded with cash and stock bonuses and are granted extra resources such as new hires. When a new game called Café World recently set a company record for growth, signing up 16 million users in its first two weeks, its head, Roy Sehgal, was rewarded with a bevy of new employees and the leather couch he had been requesting for his office for weeks. Pincus calls this style of management "true meritocracy" and says it's modeled partly after the approach at Amazon. It applies to regular staffers as much as managers. In his first three months in the poker group, Harsimran "Sim" Singh moved up the company ladder three times for helping to bring growth back into the company's longest-running game, Texas Hold'em. A year after landing at Zynga with no direct reports, the 25-year-old runs the entire poker unit, a team of 45. The Amazon influence affects how Pincus conducts his board meetings. Each time he meets with his directors, he begins by recounting whatever issue kept him awake the night before. It's a tip he learned from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, an acquaintance and role model who shares a director with Zynga. One matter getting airtime at board meetings of late: When should the company consider going public? Zynga doesn't need cash. It raised $39 million in venture capital in 2008 and hasn't touched the money since. But a publicly traded stock would give Pincus the currency to make deals or dole out employee options. Still, Pincus wants to protect the culture he has created. "We all make so many compromises in order to build our businesses that we wake up one day and we've created a company that we don't want to work at," he says. "I wanted to create a long-term home." The Man Behind Apple's AppsHow Eddy Cue and his team keep the App Store ahead of the competition If you had to choose one person who makes the world of apps go around, Eddy Cue might well be it. Apple (AAPL)'s vice-president for Internet services is the architect and overseer of Apple's App Store. Millions of iPhone owners have downloaded the 85,000 apps available from the App Store. That's light years ahead of rival offerings from Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), or Research In Motion (RIMM). Cue and his team seem on track to ensure that those mobile Internet wannabes don't close the gap anytime soon. While no rival has even 15,000 apps, his team keeps tweaking Apple's offerings to make them more attractive to consumers and useful to developers. On Oct. 14, for example, Apple told developers that for the first time they could give away apps on a trial basis and then ask consumers to pay later. "Apple has done a ridiculously good job, and now they're taking it to the next level," says Jeff Holden, chief executive of Pelago, which makes apps for the iPhone and other devices. Cue, 45, joined Apple as a lowly staffer in the IT department in time to witness the company's darkest days during the mid-1990s. He not only survived a major housecleaning after Steve Jobs returned to the company as chief executive in 1997 but emerged as one of the CEO's most trusted lieutenants. When Apple found itself playing catch-up in digital music early this decade, Jobs put Cue in charge of creating the iTunes Music Store. While far less ambitious efforts floundered, Apple's site was doling out millions of songs within weeks, with nary a hitch. Hollywood ConnectionOver time, Cue's role expanded from running the iTunes store to cutting deals to fill it. While Jobs often finalizes agreements, Cue does most of the heavy negotiations with record labels and Hollywood studios. "Eddy doesn't have attitude. That's part of his success," says one former Apple insider. "In an industry with lots of big egos, he can hold his own without saying, 'I'm the inventor of iTunes, bow before me.' One favorite approach is for Cue to "play good cop to Steve's bad cop," says the ex-employee. Apple declined to comment for this story. Cue stands out within Apple's hard-core culture for his friendly, let's-get-a-beer manner. A rabid Duke University basketball fan, he's described by insiders as an "East Coast guy's guy." But he's one of a tight-knit group that makes sure that Apple devices, software, and services work smoothly together. Many app developers don't know the role he plays or even his name. No doubt Cue has his hands full with the fast-growing App Store. When Apple rushed plans for the store into place in 2008, it was overwhelmed by the customer interest. The company had to invent the business on the fly, including how to approve and promote applications. Now Apple's back-end infrastructure may be as indispensable a competitive advantage as the iPhone's design. Developers have flocked to Apple because they see how the App Store can make huge successes of programs like Shazam and Tap Tap Revenge. Apple's success has led to controversy. Some developers gripe about delays in getting into the App Store, and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating Apple's refusal to approve an application from Google. Analysts say Apple needs to develop better ways for customers to find just the right app among the thousands of options—and thereby make the business more profitable for more developers. Still, most developers give Apple and Cue high marks. They not only established the App Store but also are building on its success. "Apple is really listening to the marketplace," says Shervin Pishevar, CEO of app developer Social Gaming Network. Enter YahooThe company is out to become the go-to place for applications Yahoo! (YHOO) has big plans for apps. While Apple may have started the app phenomenon by letting developers create programs for the iPhone, Yahoo wants to be the company that brings apps to the wider world. In the company's most ambitious app effort to year, Yahoo is redesigning its home page to include applications from outside developers. As the changes roll out through November, the apps will be listed along the left-hand side of the Yahoo.com page, used by more than 300 million people each month. Visitors can customize their own home pages, selecting the apps they want. Then they can check the day's headlines from USA Today or bid for an item on eBay (EBAY) without leaving the Yahoo site. Yahoo will make money from advertising embedded within the apps. It's also considering launching its own app store, similar to Apple's, in which case it could charge for applications and split revenues with developers. This is only one of the app frontiers Yahoo is exploring. The company has developed software for televisions that lets people launch applications such as Twitter and Facebook on the TV screen while watching their favorite shows. Another new technology allows people to tap into apps directly as they use Yahoo! Mail. Wherever people are, Yahoo wants to "summon up a gallery of all the possible things you could do," says Prabhakar Raghavan, head of Yahoo's research division. "Here are 50 million things you could do—book a ticket, upload a picture. Everything's an app." Yahoo's home page strategy is getting some traction. Dozens of software developers have signed up and landed their programs in the "App Gallery," a menu from which users can pick and choose their favorite free programs. Carrie Cronkey, the director of business development at personal finance site Mint.com, says people are more likely to join Mint if they're referred by Yahoo because it implies a level of security. "The fact that [your app] is on Yahoo makes you more credible," she says. For Yahoo, the real payoff from sprinkling apps into TVs and its home page comes in the form of data. By tracking which apps people use and how they interact with them, the company is building on its ability to serve targeted ads. That may help the company compete for ad revenues against rivals such as Google (GOOG). "Apps can play a big role in understanding user behavior," says Raghavan. Gold Rush?Money is flowing into apps as smartphones reshape the tech world When Bart Decrem went looking for office space in the spring of 2008 for his startup, Tapulous, Jeff Clavier opened his door. Clavier, the founder of venture capital firm SoftTech VC, saw enormous potential in the Tapulous software that would run on Apple's iPhone. So he let Decrem use some space in the firm's Palo Alto (Calif.) digs and made an investment in his company. Eighteen months later, Clavier's support of Tapulous looks like it may be one of his best investments ever. The company's Tap Tap Revenge app, in which players tap on-screen balls in sync to the beats of a song, has become a breakout hit. The game and its multiple spin-offs have been downloaded more than 15 million times. Tapulous, which makes money from game sales, advertising in the game, and the sale of in-game avatars, has been profitable since this summer, a speedy accomplishment for a tech startup. The investment has convinced Clavier there is loads of potential for venture capital investments in mobile applications. At last count, consumers had downloaded 2 billion programs from Apple's App Store, and that's just one place among several where people get apps. Clavier believes app startups could become billion-dollar outfits that rival traditional game and software companies. "The revenues of these companies will become substantial," he says. "There will be publishers that become large brand names." "We See Huge Markets"The torrid growth has attracted money from other high-profile investors. Last March, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield \& Byers, one of the Valley's marquee venture capitalists, launched a $100 million investment fund specifically to back startups creating software applications for the iPhone. Last October, Research In Motion (RIMM) unveiled a $150 million venture fund, with investments from Thomson Reuters (TRI) and RBC Venture Partners, to develop apps and services for its BlackBerry and other phones. And this October, U.S. mobile operator Verizon Wireless (VZ) announced an initiative to invest up to $1.3 billion in wireless applications and related technologies. "We see huge markets and game-changing opportunities," says Kevin Talbot, co-managing partner of the BlackBerry Partners Fund. Of course, investors don't need a dedicated fund to participate. Firms such as Union Square Ventures, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and XG Ventures are devoting an increasing amount of time and money to financing wireless apps. "Most of the deals we see are in the mobile arena," says Andrea Zurek, co-founder of XG Ventures, a new VC firm of former Google (GOOG) executives. The money flowing into apps is inspired by the belief that smartphones and other portable devices are transforming the tech world. The growth of mobile computing is sparking a renaissance in software development. Gaming apps are the most popular programs right now, but mobile shopping, content, social media, communications, and productivity tools are attracting increasing amounts of capital. "We don't think this is slowing down anytime soon," says Matt Murphy, the partner at Kleiner Perkins running the fund dedicated to Apple-related investments. (View an interview with Murphy here).

Propose the upyear of the definition of software ecosystems. Abstract Software ecosystems is argued to first appear as a concept more than 10 years ago and software ecosystem research started to take off in 2010. We conduct a systematic literature study, based on the most extensive literature review in the field up to year, with two primarily aims: (a) to provide an upyeard overview of the field and (b) to document evolution in the field. In total, we analyze 231 papers from 2007 until 2014 and provide an overview of the research in software ecosystems. Our analysis reveals a field that is rapidly growing, both in volume and empirical focus, while becoming more mature. We identify signs of field maturity from the increase in: (i) the number of journal articles, (ii) the empirical models within the last two years, and (iii) the number of ecosystems studied. However, we note that the field is far from mature and identify a set of challenges that are preventing the field from evolving. We propose means for future research and the community to no\_address them. Finally, our analysis shapes the view of the field having evolved outside the existing definitions of software ecosystems and thus propose the upyear of the definition of software ecosystems.

However, the implementation of telemedicine solutions in the healthcare system of Denmark has been perceived as being faced with implementation and interoperability issues, silo solutions, and lack of guidelines and standards. In this paper, we characterise the ecosystem evolved around the telemedicine services in Denmark and study the actors involved in this ecosystem. We establish a method for this study, where we define two actor roles and ways of characterizing actor contributions, and apply the method to the largest healthcare region of Denmark. Our findings reveal an ecosystem that is relatively closed to new actors, where the actors tend to be related to single telemedicine applications, the applications have low connectivity, and the most influential actors of the ecosystem can be characterised as both being beneficial and inhibitory to the ecosystem prosperity.},

  abstract = {Software has gone from obscurity to indispensability in less than fifty years. Although other industries have followed a similar trajectory, software and its supporting industry are different. In this book the authors explain, from a variety of perspectives, how software and the software industry are different—technologically, organizationally, and socially. The growing importance of software requires professionals in all fields to deal with both its technical and social aspects; therefore, users and producers of software need a common vocabulary to discuss software issues. In Software Ecosystem, Messerschmitt and Szyperski no\_address the overlapping and related perspectives of technologists and nontechnologists. After an introductory chapter on technology, the book is organized around six points of view: users, and what they need software to accomplish for them; software engineers and developers, who translate the user's needs into program code; managers, who must orchestrate the resources, material and human, to operate the software; industrialists, who organize companies to produce and distribute software; policy experts and lawyers, who must resolve conflicts inside and outside the industry without discouraging growth and innovation; and economists, who offer insights into how the software market works. Each chapter considers not only the issues most relevant to that perspective but also relates those issues to the other perspectives as well. Nontechnologists will appreciate the context in which technology is discussed; technical professionals will gain more understanding of the social issues that should be considered in order to make software more useful and successful.},

Motivated by this fact, firms are piloting different approaches of promoting their products and services to consumers in order to capitalize on the prominence of such websites. However, there is much debate in the academic and business community about the potential of social media as a platform for marketing and commerce, and the viable strategies that could constitute them as a possible solution for future ventures. Research to year has been growing, with only a limited number of studies exploring the business potential of social media. The aim of this research is to eluciyear how specific aspects of social media websites foster user intention to browse products, and the effect that this has in shaping purchasing and information sharing intentions. Utilitarian and Hedonic motivation theory provides the theoretical background on which we segregate the factors that contribute to product browsing on social media websites. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis is performed on data obtained from 165 social media users to test our research model. Outcomes indicate that specific aspects trigger Utilitarian (Convenience and Product Selection) and Hedonic (Idea and Adventure) motivations which in sequence impact user intention to browse products on such mediums. Finally, browsing intention is linked in a significantly positive manner with purchasing and word-of-mouth intention.},

In that community, companies always play auxiliary roles, and integrate the result of OSS into their business activities. However, in the Eclipse open source software community, the main role of OSS development activities is taken over by companies. The relationship between individuals and companies is reversed. Therefore, it becomes important to maintain the motivation of the development community, promote innovation and link the activities to the profit of a company. In other words, management of co-creation and competition are being conducted at the same time. This paper tries to clarify a structure of co-creation in an OSS ecosystem led by companies considering the Eclipse community as one particular case. It also constructs a co-creation process model to promote sustainable development for an OSS ecosystem following two axes 1) value sharing and value acquisition, and 2) quantitative development and qualitative development. Some mechanisms that drive this process are embedded everywhere in the Eclipse ecosystem.},

As such, we move beyond an exclusive focus on what makes Apple unique or different by evaluating the mundane and out-yeard elements of its business model. To do so, we examine the end-to-end supply chain, from source to store, to present a more holistic evaluation of the Apple business model. Drawing on the existing literature, we argue that the quintessential element of the Apple business model is its ability to ‘own the consumer’. In short, the Apple business model is designed to drive consumers into its ecosystem and then hold them there, which has been hugely successful to year and has allowed Apple to wield enormous power in the end-to-end supply chain. We demonstrate this through a detailed evaluation of Apple's physical and content supply chains and its retailing strategy.

@article{Moore1993,
  abstract = {Much has been written about networks, strategic alliances, and virtual organizations. Yet these currently popular frameworks provide little systematic assistance when it comes to out-innovating the competition. That's because most managers still view the problem in the old way: companies go head-to-head in an industry, battling for market share. James Moore sets up a new metaphor for competition drawn from the study of biology and social systems. He suggests that a company be viewed not as a member of a single industry but as a part of a business ecosystem that crosses a variety of industries. In a business ecosystem, companies "co-evolve" around a new innovation, working cooperatively and competitively to support new products and satisfy customer needs. Apple Computer, for example, leads an ecosystem that covers personal computers, consumer electronics, information, and communications. In any larger business environment, several ecosystems may vie for survival and dominance, such as the IBM and Apple ecosystems in personal computers or Wal-Mart and K mart in discount retailing. In fact, it's largely competition among business ecosystems, not individual companies, that's fueling today's industrial transformation. Managers can't afford to ignore the birth of new ecosystems or the competition among those that already exist. Whether that means investing in the right new technology, signing on suppliers to expand a growing business, developing crucial elements of value to maintain leadership, or incorporating new innovations to fend off obsolescence, executives must understand the evolutionary stages all business ecosystems go through and, more important, how to direct those changes.},

We use e3-value modelling – a formal business modelling technique – for analyzing the critical elements of these mobile ecosystems. The analysis of the app store ecosystems allows a differentiated view on the different strategies of the app store owners. Additionally, we look at the impact of network effects, economies of scale, platform differentiation, quality assurance, and transaction costs on the design of mobile application markets. This theoretical model allows a deeper discussion about the design choices and success factors in the different app store cases. Based on our analysis, we expect that the open versus closed models discussion becomes less relevant – so-called open platforms have closed aspects as well as the other way around – and that competitive differentiation and segmentation strategies will become increasingly critical in order to strengthen the competitive positioning of the different app store platforms.},

The data collected from 549 consumers show that the perceived importance of WOM remains equal to or even higher than that of self-evaluation for credence goods product quality unknown even after purchase and use and the so-called digital goods without Web access.

Unfortunately, this opening and converging mobile ecosystem has brought in more opportunities for more attacks on mobile phones, a key element of the system. This dissertation aims to achieve mobile phone security. We reveal two main chal- lenges that we need to overcome, namely developing a clear definition of secure phones, and building security infrastructure that imposes such definition on the phones. We also identify three key elements that contribute to the fidelity of mobile phones, namely, mobile phone platforms, mobile phone applications, and mobile content. Throughout this dissertation, we explore the application of security requirements engineering disci- pline in developing security policies that frame security phones from the perspectives of the above three elements. Accordingly, we develop appropriate security infrastructure on the Android platform to enforce such security policies.

Introduction of these technologies is often postponed or, once introduced, they are quickly withdrawn from the market after the first disappointing results. Rather than distinguishing alternative patterns, this article shows that the S-shaped curve and the more erratic patterns represent subsequent phases in one pattern of development and diffusion of breakthrough communication technologies. Three phases are distinguished in this pattern. Managerial implications of the differences between these phases are discussed. the paper shows that a company trying to introduce a new communication technology has to adopt different strategies in each phase.},

Mobile operating systems vendors are giving their best available resources for making applications in more convenient ways, although the development of new applications for each mobile operating system in short time is fairly a problem. Cross-platform mobile application development tools contribute in solving this problem largely. This paper presents a pragmatic comparison among four very popular cross platform tools, which are Rhodes, PhoneGap, DragonRad and MoSync. One of the main focuses of the comparison is to provide an overview on the availability of application programming interfaces, programming languages, supported mobile operating systems, licences, and integrated development environments. Furthermore, it also presents some critical points such as the factor of extensibility in tools and the effects that they may bring on market share. The comparison is aimed at supporting developers to make the right choice with respect to their needs/constraints.},

The results of the experiment show that the eWOM effect is greater for negative eWOM than for positive eWOM, greater for established websites than for unestablished websites, and greater for experience goods than for search goods. The results support the moderating effects of product type on the eWOM information direction-website reputation-eWOM effect relationship. The impact of negative eWOM on the eWOM effect is greater for experience goods than for search goods. Similarly, the impact of website reputation on the eWOM effect is greater for experience goods than for search goods. The findings provide managerial implications for an Internet marketing strategy.},

We introduce a formal model of two-sided network externalities based in textbook economics-a mix of Katz and Shapiro network effects, price discrimination, and product differentiation. Externality-based complements, however, exploit a different mechanism than either tying or lock-in even as they help to explain many recent strategies such as those of firms selling operating systems, Internet browsers, games, music, and video. The model presented here argues for three simple but useful results. First, even in the absence of competition, a firm can rationally invest in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity. Second, we identify distinct markets for content providers and end consumers and show that either can be a candiyear for a free good. Third, product coupling across markets can increase consumer welfare even as it increases firm profits. The model also generates testable hypotheses on the size and direction of network effects while offering insights to regulators seeking to apply antitrust law to network markets.},

To encourage third-party developers, how long should their intellectual property interests last? We no\_address these questions through a sequential innovation model that balances two sets of tradeoffs. (i) Closing the platform increases the sponsor's ability to charge for access, while opening the platform increases developer ability to build upon it. (ii) The longer third-party developers retain property rights to their innovations, the higher the royalties they and the sponsor earn, but the sooner those developers rights expire, the sooner their innovations become a public good upon which other ecosystem developers can build. Our model allows us to characterize the optimal levels of openness and of IP duration in a platform ecosystem. We also model the relative profit potential of a sponsoring firm's decision to vertically integrate into downstream production as a closed hierarchy or to organize itself as a platform for open innovation. We use standard tools of Cobb-Douglas production and two-sided networks to derive our results. These findings can inform innovation strategy, choice of organizational form, intellectual property law, and management of competition.},

They are based upon the inclusion of an evolutionary social history (Ernst Mayr), species-level evolution (Eldredge and Gould), and local context (Martin Heidegger) as central premises in the definition of human systems. The colonial viewpoint of systems is differentiated from the mechanistic and organic models by ten different axioms that define how systems operate during both homeostasis (stability) and radical change. From the axiomatic descriptions of colonial systems, the method of punctuated prototyping is derived to clarify how local colonies survive and prosper by creating and adopting isolated prototypes. This change mechanism (1) requires the self-awareness to recognize the necessity for change, and (2) describes the empowerment necessary for the colonists to build and adopt successful prototypes. The colonial systems model can be applied to explanations about how information systems, organizations, and social institutions change. Further, colonies can be used as a metaphor to design new human systems that capture a greater degree of humanness than do the models of machines and organisms.},

Porter's Competitive Advantage explores the underpinnings of competitive advantage in the individual firm. With over 30 printings in English and translated into thirteen languages, this second volume in Porter's landmark trilogy describes how a firm actually gains an advantage over its rivals. Competitive Advantage introduces a whole new way of understanding what a firm does. Porter's groundbreaking concept of the value chain disaggregates a company into "activities," or the discrete functions or processes that represent the elemental building blocks of competitive advantage. Now an essential part of international business thinking, Competitive Advantage takes strategy from broad vision to an internally consistent configuration of activities. Its powerful framework provides the tools to understand the drivers of cost and a company's relative cost position. Porter's value chain enables managers to isolate the underlying sources of buyer value that will command a premium price, and the reasons why one product or service substitutes for another. He shows how competitive advantage lies not only in activities themselves but in the way activities relate to each other, to supplier activities, and to customer activities. Competitive Advantage also provides for the first time the tools to strategically segment an industry and rigorously assess the competitive logic of diversification. That the phrases "competitive advantage" and "sustainable competitive advantage" have become commonplace is testimony to the power of Porter's ideas. Competitive Advantage has guided countless companies, business school students, and scholars in understanding the roots of competition. Porter's work captures the extraordinary complexity of competition in a way that makes strategy both concrete and actionable.},

The most representative case was then selected for a closer examination with the results presented in accordance with the research framework. According to the results, the Open Telco concept creates an ecosystem that enables a two-sided platform. However, positive network effects require at least national coverage; developers want innovative pricing schema and novel payment services need changes for regulation.

Based on an extensive literature review and empirical research, this study investigates the factors that drive business model design and the performance effects generated by the different kinds of business models in software firms. The main research question is: “What are the determinants of business model performance in the software industry?? To no\_address this question, the study conceptually and empirically investigates three topical issues in the software industry: (1) the prolific service dominance in software delivery; (2) the growing role of information technology in business; and (3) the openness of innovation activity in software development. These issues and the manifestations of software firms’ diverse business models are analyzed in five separate essays included in this dissertation. First, the study formalizes the definitions of software firms’ business models as the theoretical and conceptual layer between corporate strategies and operational processes. Second, it investigates the antecedents to business models through an empirical multimethod approach. It organizes the extant interdisciplinary research centered on the three firm-level orientations of service orientation, technology orientation, and openness of innovation activity, into a research model that explains the variation evident in software firms’ business models. Third, the study discusses the contingent role of business model type in the determination of firm performance. The performance effects of different types of business models are analyzed through a quantitative empirical study using structural equation modeling of data gathered from almost 200 software firms. This study makes several contributions to theory and practice. Overall, it adds to the understanding of the complex relationships among business model determinants, business model type, and firm performance. The results add to the resource-based theory of the firm and its extensions, as well as to the research on services and open innovation. According to the analysis, software firms with a service-oriented mindset are likely to focus on customer proximity in their business models. Such business models have a stronger relationship with financial performance than with market performance. Conversely, firms engaged in open innovation focus mostly on product uniformity, meaning that their innovation activity emphasizes the development of products and services that are new to the industry. Such companies have better market performance than financial performance. Moreover, the findings indicate that technological issues constitute an important antecedent in all types of business models.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, metaphors drawn from human health are finding increasing application in environmental assessment at ecosystem levels. If ecosystem medicine is to come of age, it must cope with three fundamental dilemmas. The first stems from the recognition that there are no strictly objective criteria for judging health. Assessments of health, as in humans, inevitably are based on some combination of established norms and desirable attributes. The second stems from the irregular pulse of nature which either precludes the early recognition of substantive changes or gives rise to false alarms. The third is posed by the quest for indicators that have the attributes of being holistic, early warning, and diagnostic. Indicators that excel in one of these aspects, often fail in another. Advances in ecosystem medicine are likely to come from closer collaboration with medical colleagues in both clinical and epidemiological areas. In particular the time appears ripe for a more systematic effort to characterize ecosystem maladies, to valiyear treatments and to develop more sophisticated diagnostic protocols. These aspects are illustrated with comparisons drawn from studies of environmental transformation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, the Baltic Sea and Canadian terrestrial ecosystems.},

The field is advancing with the articulation of the linkages between human activity, regional and global environmental change, reduction in ecological services and the consequences for human health, economic opportunity and human communities. Increasing our understanding of these interactions will involve more active collaboration between the ecological, social and health sciences. In this, ecologists will have substantive and catalytic roles.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, mobile applications are becoming increasingly more present in our daily life, allowing people to perform several tasks through the use of smartphones, tablets or equivalent devices. Despite the great benefits in terms of innovation and in the variety of available solutions, the rapid and continuous growth of the mobile market has resulted in some fragmentation of the platforms that support each mobile device. The existence of different mobile operating systems with different programming languages and development tools can be a problem when someone wants to release an application in as many platforms as possible. The typical approach of simply rewriting the application for each one of those platforms is usually impracticable either in terms of budget or development time, requiring a bigger effort to be made. Therefore, a solution that could generate an application for several platforms (multi or cross-platform) without compromising the overall quality of the application would decrease the time to market of the application and increase enormously the number of potential users. Providentially, during the last years some effort has been conducted to tackle this problem, especially with the emergence of Domain Specific Languages (DSL), tools and frameworks that facilitate the development of cross-platform mobile applications. This paper focuses in these technologies and attempts to provide a global view of the actual state of this area.},

To succeed, platforms in industries such as software, portals and media, payment systems and the Internet, must “get both sides of the market on board.? Accordingly, platforms devote much attention to their business model, that is, to how they court each side while making money overall. This paper builds a model of platform competition with two-sided markets. It unveils the determinants of price alno\_location and end-user surplus for different governance structures (profit-maximizing platforms and not-for-profit joint undertakings), and compares the outcomes with those under an integrated monopolist and a Ramsey planner.

The mixture of declining revenues and fierce competition was believed to shake the market and soon to dethrone former national champions. However, there are ways to fight that extinction and one way is to open up for competitive advantage. This paper reflects on a case study at Deutsche Telekom, the German national telecommunication operator. The aim of this study is to analyse to what extent the open innovation paradigm has been embraced inside this now multinational company. Using empirical evidence from 15 in-depth interviews, we identify 11 open innovation instruments and detail their value contribution. We can show that Deutsche Telekom has successfully enhanced its innovation capacity by opening up its traditional development process and embracing external creativity and knowledge resources.},

Inspired on properties of natural and business ecosystems, SECO covers technical and business aspects of software development as well as partnership among companies. In this paper, we undertake a review on SECOs status as an emerging research topic in SE community. We map what is currently known about SECOs and also analyze them in a three-dimensional perspective in SE, i.e., technical, business and social. We observed that SECOs research is concentrated in eight main areas in which the most relevant ones are open source software, ecosystem modeling, and business issues.

Such systems are composed of components potentially under two or more licenses, open source or proprietary or both, in an architecture in which evolution can occur by evolving existing components, replacing them, or refactoring. The software licenses of the components both facilitate and constrain the system's ecosystem and its evolution, and the licensesâ€™ rights and obligations are crucial in producing an acceptable system. Consequently, software component licenses and the architectural composition of a system help to better define the software ecosystem niche in which a given system lies. Understanding and describing software ecosystem niches for open architecture systems is a key contribution of this work. An example open architecture software system that articulates different niches is employed to this end. We examine how the architecture and software component licenses of a composed system at design time, build time, and run time help determine the system's software ecosystem niche and provide insight and guidance for identifying and selecting potential evolutionary paths of system, architecture, and niches.},

Still, we consider ecosystems as entities with a distinctive character and individual characteristics. Ecosystem maintenance and preservation form the objective of impact analysis, hazard evaluation, and other management or regulation activities. In this article we explore an approach to ecosystem analysis which identifies and quantifies factors which define the condition or state of an ecosystem in terms of health criteria. We relate ecosystem health to human/nonhuman animal health and explore the difficulties of defining ecosystem health and suggest criteria which provide a functional definition of state and condition. We suggest that, as has been found in human/nonhuman animal health studies, disease states can be recognized before disease is of clinical magnitude.

Section ‘Developer-focused issues’ deals with the relationship between Apple and app developers; three themes of Apple’s Guidelines are identified (content, development and payments), and the ways in which control can be challenged (through jailbreaking, ‘web apps’ and regulatory intervention) are scrutinized. Section ‘Citizen- and consumer-focused issues’ considers three ways in which apps are already regulated by law. The focus is on the protection of consumers (particularly through the UK system for ‘premium rate services’), but a discussion of user privacy and the regulation of video games and video-on-demand services in Europe is also included. Finally, in the section ‘Conclusion’, the tension between comparatively ‘open’ and ‘closed’ app stores is highlighted; the problems of applying general provisions to emerging formats are emphasized. It is concluded that the emerging status of non-carrier app stores as neither retailer nor platform means that it is not yet possible to identify the form of regulation that is in operation, but that some steps are available to legislators that could shift the balance between closed and open models.},

IT platforms are general purpose technologies that are used by application developers to build specific applications for individual or organizational needs. IT platform adoption is different from the adoption of independent IT, in that (1) platform adoption requires substantial up-front knowledge investments, (2) the potential benefits from such adoption depend on network externalities, and (3) adopters are developers rather than end-users. To understand what factors drive IT platform adoption, we interviewed 35 developers of mobile applications and analyzed their responses using a grounded theoretic approach. Our findings suggests that a wide range of factors drive IT platform adoption, including platform characteristics, network externalities, personal motivation, personal knowledge and innovativeness, and social influence.},

The adoption of specific platforms is of tremendous importance in the IT industry; as developers choose particular platforms, they influence the programming languages, applications, and technologies that will become dominant in the future. IT adoption has been a popular area of research for several decades, with a number of theoretical explanations having been developed. IT adoption, however, may differ systematically from IT platform adoption. To investigate the factors that influence IT platform adoption, and whether those factors differ from those that are relevant in IT adoption, we conduct an interpretive field study, analyzing interviews with mobile application developers.

This ecology involves large telcos and equipment manufacturers, as well as a mass of third party application developers and hundreds of millions of mobile Internet users. It allows Google to use and build on the contributions of independent programmers. More importantly, it facilitates the harvesting of valuable metadata of Android users, crucial for the development of new no\_location--specific services and advertising.

It is a universal fact that SMEs in all countries provide a substantial proportion of total employment, and conduct much of a nation’s innovative activity. Yet these smaller companies struggle in global markets on a far from level playing field, where large companies have distinct advantages. To redress this imbalance the Commission saw it as a priority to improve the trading capability of the Small and Medium–sized Enterprises (SMEs), and perceived digital platforms as the modern means to this end. They considered that the best operational model for a vibrant Web2.0-based Internet services industry would be by analogy to well-performing biological ecosystems. Open Source Software is adopted in the DBE/OPAALS projects as the best support for sustainability of such complex electronic webs, since it minimises interoperability problems, enables code access for cheaper in-house modification or development of systems, and reduces both capital and operating expenditure.},

Although prior work on indirect network effects in the economics and marketing literature is valuable, there are two main shortcomings. First, empirical analysis of indirect network effects is rare. Second, in contrast to the importance prior literature credits to the “chicken-and-egg? paradox in these markets, the temporal pattern (i.e., Which leads to which?) of indirect network effects remains unstudied. Based on empirical evidence of nine markets, this study shows that (1) indirect network effects, as commonly operationalized by prior literature, are weaker than expected from prior literature and (2) in most markets examined, hardware sales “lead? software availability, whereas the reverse almost never happens, contrary to existing beliefs. These findings are supported by multiple methods, such as takeoff and time-series analyses, and fit with the histories of the markets studied herein. For academia, the study identifies a need for new and more relevant conceptualizations of indirect network effects. For public policy, it questions the need for intervention in network markets. For management practice, it downplays the importance of the availability of a large library of software for hardware technology to be successful.},

Based on its informational role, a higher variance would correspond to a higher subsequent demand if and only if the average rating is low. We find empirical evidence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions with book data from Amazon.com and BN.com. A higher standard deviation of ratings on Amazon improves a book's relative sales rank when the average rating is lower than 4.1 stars, which is true for 35\% of all the books in our sample.},

In this study we take an longitudinal approach by analysing the results of 1 928 responses to an online questionnaire conducted in Finland to students of a university in the Spring 2012 and on against the reanalysis of the responses of the Finnish students of upper secondary schools in the Spring 2001 and study on undergraduate students in 2006--2007. The results indicate that the youth and young adults of Finland, often argued to be an advanced country for mobile services, are surprisingly conservative towards new mobile devices and services. The changes in technology and service offering in a decade, has had a limited impact in attitudes and feature valuation, which sets significant implications to increasing adoption and usage.},

The first objective is to estimate the existence of application vendors locating in developing countries. The second objective is to identify some reasons for developing country software vendors to enter mobile application markets rather than more traditional software markets. We argue that app stores offer a possibility for developing countries to pass some of the problems that come with industrialisation by partly post-industrialising directly. This study is divided to two phases which study the existence of application vendors in developing countries and their characteristics from different viewpoints. The first phase focuses on the analysis of the most popular applications in Google Play, Apple Store and Windows Phone Store. The second phase starts by analysing the email no\_addresses of application vendors who sell their products in Google Play marketplace for devices using Android operating system and continues by sending questionnaire to those application vendors whose email no\_addresses has country domain belonging to developing country. Our study shows that mobile applications are developed in developing countries, although, the biggest part of application vendors is located in developed countries. Among developing countries, most important mobile application producers belong to upper-middle income economies, such as China or Russia, or to lower-middle income economies, such as India. However, there appears to be few application vendors who operate from low income economies, such as Bangladesh or Kenya. According to our results, application vendors located in developing countries choose to develop mobile applications largely due to same reasons than application vendors located in developed countries. They prefer mobile application marketplaces, because they offer easy access to large amount of potential customers. Android platform is appreciated for its low development and access cost, however, it is criticized for the wide range of customer interfaces.},

Thus, the investor is faced with the problem of valuing "implementation opportunities." We then compare different valuation techniques for this task and discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. The practical advantages of employing such models are demonstrated by describing a real-life case study where option pricing models were used for deciding whether to continue employing SAP R/2 or to switch to SAP R/3.},

The paper demonstrates that when imitation is easy, markets don't work well, and the profits from innovation may accrue to the owners of certain complementary assets, rather than to the developers of the intellectual property. This speaks to the need, in certain cases, for the innovating firm to establish a prior position in these complementary assets. The paper also indicates that innovators with new products and processes which provide value to consumers may sometimes be so ill positioned in the market that they necessarily will fail. The analysis provides a theoretical foundation for the proposition that manufacturing often matters, particularly to innovating nations.

A software ecosystem does not evolve in insulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed the OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to understand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We attempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to other software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to theoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing seven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each other: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic management of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and reputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs, competitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research no\_addressing the evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that software ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways, even with competing ones.

  abstract = {We adopt actor-network theory to examine how technical and human actors interact to reach agreement on the creation and adoption of wireless services and standards. We present a model in which actors formulate standardization strategies based on their perceptions of existing and future actor-network configurations in light of their interests. The model is used to explore changes in the US wireless industry in the midst of its transition to the third generation (3G) technologies. We interview top executives from key players in the US wireless industry and analyze a major US wireless network operator’s standardization strategy using the model. The new technical potential offered by 3G has instigated a transformation of the industry’s actor-network and stimulated renewed interest in standards setting and adoption. Operators have been among the most influential actors in initiating and enabling this transformation even though the technical potential has largely been brought to light and standardized by others. New relationships need to be established with, and among, diverse industry actors through specific standards exploitation plans. As a result new technological interfaces and inter-organizational arrangements are being forged to exploit the emerging technological potential. These strategies are, for the moment, ambiguous and open due to the uncertain nature of standards creation and adoption choices as well as rapid change in the market place (including the impact of ongoing mergers).},

  abstract = {The transition of the wireless industry from second generation (2G) to third generation (3G) is more than a simple technology upgrade. The industry's service profile will move far beyond telephony and services will converge with the computing and content sectors. This will bring many more players into this already huge industry. Thus the transition to 3G needs to be regarded as a major economic transformation as it requires a major reconfiguration of the existing value networks. Standards have traditionally been essential in the success of wireless services and will play an increasingly critical role in the future. Due to the on-going transition, wireless standardization has changed considerablyâ€?reflecting changes in the configuration of the value network. While the number of major air-interface standards has been reduced to just two, the overall number of standards bodies has increased by almost an order of magnitude while the number and scope of interfaces being standardized has grown at a breathtaking pace. This growth reflects the need to support the industry's new coordination requirements at critical interfaces in the value network. At the same time, the importance of the traditional standards development organizations (SDOs) has diminished as more nimble industry consortia have taken over the main responsibilities for standardization. The major standardization battlegrounds have shifted up the protocol stack to the service enabler level. In addition, the manufacture of handsets and other mobile communication devices is transitioning to a more horizontal industry structure. These changes, along with changes in the way value is extracted from new services and their influence on the reconfiguration of the industry are discussed.},

We discuss how change and control are paradoxically related in digital infrastructures and how they affect the evolution of such infrastructures. We examine these paradoxes by examining the change in, and competition between, two mobile operating systems: Apple's iOS and Google's Android along with their related platform features and ecologies. We seek to valiyear a proposed theoretical framework of the dynamics of change and control through second-order analysis of the two cases. We observe that multiple factors had a significant effect on the evolution of these platforms including user interface, development platforms, business models, and value extraction principles. We observe how these factors significantly affect the evolution of mobile platform ecologies as well as speculate about the future of mobile system platforms.},

Throughout 2011, consumers who had previously enjoyed unrestricted use of independent tethering applications found that major network providers significantly curtailed their functionality and availability. 7 Tethering, sometimes called mobile hot-spotting, refers to software applications that enable devices with cellular modems, typically smartphones, to serve as an Internet connection for devices ...},

  abstract = {This paper presents a structural analysis of the Internet search engine market. Search engines are a core element of the Internet media system, topping the Nielsen NetRatings Top 10 list of online properties in every market measured and generating advertising revenues of billions of dollars each year. Using a search engine is the most popular online activity after reading email. A political economy approach is used to identify the relevant parties in the system, their ownership, their exchanges, and the constraints to which they are subjected. The market is shown to be similar to other media markets in that it is both highly concentrated and global in scope, and funded primarily by advertising. However, there are several important differences. First, although traditional media conglomerates operate online, they do not control the most powerful actors such as Google and Yahoo!. Second, the advertising market is structured differently. Advertising is normally linked to words entered as search terms by users, and this keyword-based advertising is syndicated to other search engines, large and small, primarily by Google and Yahoo!-owned Overture, increasing their influence. Third, the situation is complicated by new commercial actors called search engine optimisation companies who operate within a grey market often in opposition to search engine companies, to strengthen the rank of their clients in search engine results. Recent studies within the computer science discipline have shown search engine results to be systematically biased in favour of commercial sites, popular sites, and US-based sites. With no public service manyear and little regulation, the study raises the question of whether the current system of search provision online serves the ‘public good’.},

Further, we focus on the business model elements of an application developer which can be subdivided in recurrent elements (e.g.: cost structure, key partners, resources, key activities, promotion channels, customer relationships and revenue streams) or unique elements (value proposition and customer segments). This actor specific research allows us to 1) develop a decision chart and 2) to extend existing guidelines in order to determine the most optimal revenue model for a mobile application.

This paper discusses the role of open mobile software platforms in creating the market for niche mobile applications. In particular, the transformation of the mobile industry from mobile communications towards computer and Internet industries is discussed, with a particular focus on the open software platforms of mobile phones that facilitate innovation. This study makes a hypothesis that open software platforms are boosting the use of niche applications. The paper consequently collects empirical data on smartphone usage over three consequent years in Finland. The dataset of 1 145 smartphone users is analyzed in studying whether the long-tail phenomenon is evident in the demand for mobile applications. The analysis of usage-level data reveals that the application demand is more heterogenic in the newest panel study than in the earlier studies. In other words, though the top 5\% of applications typically represent more than 90\% of total application usage, the bottom 80\% of applications (the long-tail part) already represent 2.10\% of total observed application usage in 2007, whereas this tail is only 1.39\% in 2006 and 0.89\% in 2005. In the newest dataset of 2007, 6.9\% of top applications represent 93.1\% of total smartphone usage. The analysis reveals a U-relationship between the number of users and mean usage frequency of applications. This means that many of the niche applications are being used actively by those who installed them, suggesting that the value of add-on applications is high.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the impact of Intellectual Property (IP) modular architecture on software products and software platform ecosystems. A software system is IP modular when its module boundaries separate parts of a system that have to be treated differently with respect to IP. The IP status is then homogeneous within each module, but may differ between modules. IP rights can be formal IP such as licensing contracts or copyright, but also informal IP like keeping the source code secret. The presented results in this dissertation are based on a detailed qualitative case study analysis of two software products and two software platforms and on a quantitative study of two software ecosystems. The results extend the existing literature on IP modularity by demonstrating a direct association between IP modular product or platform architecture and the related business models. The analysis also shows that the early consideration of IP-related requirements in the requirements engineering process of software systems can prevent costly and time-consuming re-modularizations. The quantitative analysis in two software ecosystems shows that IP modular platform architecture, which can allow increased openness while still maintaining value appropriation, can increase a platform’s attractiveness for complementors. To summarize, this dissertation demonstrates the connections between IP management, software architecture and the respective business models of software product or platform providers.},

Here it is argued that the success of the iPhone was based on Apple's conception of the mobile Internet as being another modality of the existing wired Internet, and its leveraging of existing systems competencies. It is demonstrated how a promise to deliver the ï¿½real Internetï¿½ was a core part of Apple's original strategy, and that iPhone users quickly showed an interest in web browsing disproportionate to any other mobile phone in the US or Europe.

Here, we examine Symbian Ltd., a startup firm that developed a strong technical architecture and broad range of third-party complements with its Symbian OS for smartphones. Symbian was shipped in nearly 450 million mobile phones from 2000 to 2010, making it the most popular smartphone platform during that period. However, its technical and market control of the platform were limited by its customers, particularly Nokia. From 2007 onward, Symbian lost market share and developer loyalty to the new iPhone and Android platforms, leading to the extinction of the company and eventually its platform. Together, this suggests lessons for the evolution of a complex ecosystem, and the impact of asymmetric dependencies and divided leadership upon ecosystem success.},

Thus the empirical and prescriptive content of the popular Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole (2006) model of two-sided markets turns on the nature of user heterogeneity. I propose a more plausible, yet equally tractable, model of heterogeneity in which users differ in their income or scale.

In this study, we focus on the governance of a hardware-dependent software ecosystem. More specifically, we evaluate the governance model applied by Axis, a network video and surveillance camera producer, that is the platform owner and orchestrator of the Application Development Partner (ADP) software ecosystem. We conduct an exploratory case study collecting data from observations and interviews and apply the governance model for prevention and improvement of the software ecosystem health proposed by Jansen and Cusumano. Our results reveal that although the governance actions do not no\_address the majority of their governance model, the ADP ecosystem is considered a growing ecosystem providing opportunities for its actors. This can be explained by the fact that Axis, as the orchestrator and the platform owner, does not no\_address the productivity and robustness of the ecosystem adequately, but has a network of vendors and resellers to support it and some of the governance activities (e.g. communication) are achieved by non-formal means. The current governance model does not take into consideration.},

  abstract = {abstractBackground Software ecosystems emerged as means for several actors to jointly provide more value to the market than any of them can do on its own. Recently, software ecosystems are more often used to support the development of hardware-dependent solutions. Objectives This work aims at studying barriers and bridges to participation in an ecosystem with substantial hardware dependencies. Method We conducted an interview-based case study of an ecosystem around Axis’ network video surveillance systems, interviewing 10 internal experts and 8 external representatives of 6 companies, complemented by document studies at Axis. Results Major bridges to the ecosystem include end customer demands, open and transparent communication and relationship, as well as internal and external standardizations. Barriers include the two-tier business model, entry barriers and execution performance issues. Approximately half of the identified bridges and barriers could be considered hardware-dependent ecosystems specific. Conclusion Our results suggest that ecosystem leaders should share their sales channels with the ecosystem participants and focus on good communication and relationships as the dominant factors for the ecosystem participation. Moreover, we report that internal and external standardization can play a dual role, not only ease the development but also enable additional sales channels and new opportunities for the ecosystem participants. At the same time, the business model selected by the ecosystem leaders and performance, are identified as the main barriers to ecosystem participation. We believe that the business model barrier may be much more important for similar hardware-dependent software ecosystems.},

This phenomenon imposes severe constraints, such as the use of different development environments, technologies, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for each mobile platform, leading inevitably to a waste of development time and effort, and an increased maintenance cost. The paper focuses on the current trends in developing cross-platform mobile apps. Our analysis focuses primarily on three areas. In the first place, we clarify the cross-platform development landscape by exploring the most important cross-platform app types, which are web, hybrid, interpreted and generated apps. Secondly, key issues for each app type are presented and a comparative analysis is performed to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each type. Thirdly, taking into account the current status in cross-platform mobile app development we identify a promising cross-platform app type and we investigate its effectiveness in practice. Finally, we draw some conclusions regarding cross-platform mobile app development approaches and make proposals for further research on the field.},

The results indicate that a complete ecosystem, where mobile network operators collaborate closely with value-added service providers, content/application providers, equipment and device manufacturers, and other involved organizations, can promote the development of mobile data services substantially. Therefore, mobile network operators should play a central role in the ecosystem by managing the entire value-chain and setting up proper value-sharing mechanisms. However, while doing so, problems may arise because of regulatory issues and information asymmetry. High-value common assets, a centralized management system, partner selection schemes and continuous innovations are important success factors.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this research is to help better understand the impact of online user reviews on sales of search goods. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on digital camera sales data collected from amazon.com and two studies are included in this research. The first study is based on a static model and sample data from one time stamp. The second study is based on two sample data collected from two different time stamps, and a dynamic model is proposed. Findings: The results from the first study reveal that the average online customer review, the number of online reviews, the price and the camera's physical properties such as the number of pixels and the optimal zoom number (but not LCD screen size) have significant influence on digital camera sales. The results from the second study show that the sales from the previous period are an important indicator for future sales. In addition, change in price, change in average online review rating and change in the total number of online reviews are all significantly associated with future sales. Research limitations/implications: The research reveals that there is a significant relationship between the online user review and sales of search goods, and the influence of online user reviews on search goods sales is different from that on experience goods. It also recognizes that the product specifications influence the sales of search goods. In addition, the research on search goods shows that price at the specific time and price changes are significant factors affecting sales. Practical implications: The research indicates that retailers should provide channels for, and encourage, customer online reviews for search goods to improve sales. It is also beneficial for online retailers to provide detailed product attributes to help their customers make the purchase decision. Carefully designed and executed price promotions could also be effective ways to improve sales of searchable goods. Originality/value: This study is one of the first attempts to investigate the impact of online user reviews on sales of search goods.},

However, app repackaging, among many other threats, brings tremendous risk to the ecosystem, including app developers, app market operators, and end users. To mitigate such threat, we propose and develop a watermarking mechanism for Android apps. First, towards automatic watermark embedding and extraction, we introduce the novel concept of manifest app, which is a companion of a target Android app under protection. We then design and develop a tool named AppInk, which takes the source code of an app as input to automatically generate a new app with a transparently-embedded watermark and the associated manifest app. The manifest app can be later used to reliably recognize embedded watermark with zero user intervention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AppInk in preventing app repackaging, we analyze its robustness in defending against distortive, subtractive, and additive attacks, and then evaluate its resistance against two open source repackaging tools. Our results show that AppInk is easy to use, effective in defending against current known repackaging threats on Android platform, and introduces small performance overhead.},

Specifically, (1) the business model is emerging as a new unit of analysis; (2) business models emphasize a system-level, holistic approach to explaining how firms “do business?; (3) firm activities play an important role in the various conceptualizations of business models that have been proposed; and (4) business models seek to explain how value is created, not just how it is captured. These emerging themes could serve as catalysts for a more unified study of business models.},

It constitutes a fundamental step towards an empirically based, nuanced understanding of the implications for management, governance, and control of software ecosystems. This is the first book of its kind dedicated to this emerging field and offers guidelines on how to analyze software ecosystems; methods for managing and growing; methods on transitioning from a closed software organization to an open one; and instruments for dealing with open source, licensing issues, product management and app stores. It is unique in bringing together industry experiences, academic views and tackling challenges such as the definition of fundamental concepts of software ecosystems, describing those forces that influence its development and lifecycles, and the provision of methods for the governance of software ecosystems. This book is an essential starting point for software industry researchers, product managers, and entrepreneurs. Contributors: T. Aaltonen, T.A. Alspaugh, C. Alves, M. Anvaari, H.U. Asuncion, O.

@article{BapnaBarua_et_al2010,
  abstract = {Multisourcing, the practice of stitching together best-of-breed IT services from multiple, geographically dispersed service providers, represents the leading edge of modern organizational forms. While major strides have been achieved in the last decade in the information systems (IS) and strategic management literature in improving our understanding of outsourcing, the focus has been on a dyadic relationship between a client and a vendor. We demonstrate that a straightforward extrapolation of such a dyadic relationship falls short of addressing the nuanced incentive-effort-output linkages that arise when multiple vendors, who are competitors, have to cooperate and coordinate to achieve the client's business objectives. We suggest that when multiple vendors have to work together to deliver end-to-end services to a client, the choice of formal incentives and relational governance mechanisms depends on the degree of interdependence between the various tasks as well as the observability and verifiability of output. With respect to cooperation, we find that a vendor must not only put effort in a “primary” task it is responsible for but also cooperate through “helping” effort in enabling other vendors perform their primary tasks. In the context of coordination, we find that task redesign for modularity, OLAs, and governance structures such as the guardian vendor model represent important avenues for further research. Based on the analysis of actual multisourcing contract details over the last decade, interviews with leading practitioners, and a review of the single-sourcing literature, we lay a foundation for normative theories of multisourcing and present a research agenda in this domain.},

@article{SusarlaBarua_et_al2010,
  abstract = {We examine contract choices in the provision of "software-as-a-service" (SaaS), which is a business innovation that transforms information technology (IT) resources into a continuously provided service. We draw upon agency theory and modularity theory to propose that one of the central challenges in service disaggregation is that of knowledge interdependencies across client and provider organizations. The resulting lack of verifiability of certain tasks results in a multitask agency problem. Our key research questions involve (1) the suitability of high- versus low-powered incentives in SaaS contracts when the outsourced tasks involve business analytics that are difficult to verify, and (2) how such contract choices are affected by the modularity of interfaces between the client and the provider. Analysis of data collected from 154 providers of SaaS offering a range of IT services supports our contention that when contracting for business analytics characterized by knowledge interdependencies across clients and providers, incentives should be "low powered." Modularity in the interfaces of the service provider increases the desirability of high-powered incentives in such situations. Our results are robust after accounting for endogeneity issues arising from unobserved matching between service providers and the nature of IT services outsourced by clients. With the increasing importance of information systems in services, this paper suggests that arm's-length relationships and high-powered incentives may be ineffective in incentivizing providers to perform on complex business analytic tasks, unless accompanied by the modularization of interfaces.},

Methods The FITNESSGRAM test battery assessed students (n = 838) in the five components of health-related fitness. The Illinois Standardized Achievement Test (ISAT) was used to assess academic achievement in reading and math. Results The largest correlations were seen for aerobic fitness and muscular endurance (ranging from 0.12 to 0.27, all p < 0.05). Boys in the Healthy Fitness Zone (HFZ) for aerobic fitness or muscular endurance were 2.5–3 times more likely to pass their math or reading exams. Girls in the HFZ for aerobic fitness were approximately 2–4 times as likely to meet or exceed reading and math test standards. Conclusions Aerobic capacity and muscular endurance seem to positively affect academic achievement in middle school students.},

Leisure-time physical activity, body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and maximal oxygen uptake were assessed. During leisure time, the majority (53.5\\%) of female students were found to be sedentary, while the majority of male students (49.6\\%) were found to be active (P<0.001). Active students, both males (P<0.05) and females (P<0.05), had higher absolute and relative values than their sedentary counterparts. No statistically significant differences were found in anthropometric or blood pressure values according to the different physical activity classification levels. In contrast, relative was negatively associated with percentage body fat (males: P<0.01; females: P<0.01) and body mass index (males: P<0.01; females: P<0.01). We also found a negative association between relative and systolic (males: P<0.05; females: P<0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (males: P<0.01; females: P<0.01). The present results indicate that poor physical fitness, evaluated in terms of relative , is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in university students. This is a cause for concern, especially for male studentsp, since their aerobic capacity was found to be rather low.},

It was hypothesized that more intrinsic motives and more self-determined regulations would be associated with better fitness. Exercise motives of students participating in physical activity classes (N = 194) were assessed using the Motives for Physical Activity Measure–Revised (MPAM–R) and behavioral regulations were assessed with the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 2 (BREQ–2). Aerobic fitness was assessed using the PACER run test, and body composition was assessed using hand-held, bio-electric impedance analyzers. MPAM–R and BREQ–2 subscales were regressed onto the two fitness measures. For the MPAM–R, stronger competence and fitness motives predicted better fitness and stronger appearance motives predicted worse fitness. For the BREQ–2, higher intrinsic motivation predicted better aerobic fitness, and stronger, introjected regulation predicted higher body fat composition. These findings have implications for fitness professionals and physical educators.},

This analytic distinction presents some limitations in explaining how coordination is reached in organizations characterized by distributed teams, scarce face to face meetings and fuzzy and changing lines of authority, as in free/libre open source software (FLOSS) development. Analyzing empirical illustrations from two FLOSS projects, we highlight the existence of a peculiar model, stigmergic coordination, which includes aspects of both implicit and explicit mechanisms. The work product itself (implicit) and the characteristics under which it is shared (explicit) play an under-appreciated role in helping software developers manage dependencies as they arise. We develop this argument beyond the existing literature by working with an existing coordination framework, considering the role that the codebase itself might play at each step. We also discuss the features and the practices to support stigmergic coordination in distributed teams, as well as recommendations for future research.},

First, we review several key principles of the resource-based view (RBV) and show how they apply to community as a strategic resource, incorporating prior work that simultaneously addresses communities and RBV. Next, we juxtapose pairs of firms in the same industries, comparing those that have embraced this strategy with those that have not, demonstrating the superior sustainability of the firms that consider community as a strategic resource. Finally, we conclude with thoughts as to a future research agenda that allows for an expansion of the concept of resources to further the development of RBV, the firms that apply it, and the communities in which they are embedded. In doing so, we demonstrate how expanding RBV to incorporate the community as strategic resource contributes to managerial theory, research, and practice.},

Following an introduction on the emergence and foundations of strategy-as-practice, the review is structured in three main parts, based on the terminology, issues and research agendas outlined in the field. First, the paper examines the concepts of practitioners and praxis. A typology of nine possible domains for strategy-as-practice research is developed, based on the way that different studies conceptualize the strategy practitioner and the level of strategy praxis that they aim to explain. Second, the paper reviews the concept of practices, which has been adopted widely but inconsistently within the strategy-as-practice literature. While there is no dominant view on practices, the review maps the various concepts of practices that inform the strategy-as-practice field and outlines avenues for future research. The final section attends to the call for strategy-as-practice research to develop and substantiate outcomes that may better explain or inform strategy praxis. Five categories of outcomes are found within existing empirical studies, and an agenda for building upon this evidence is advanced. The paper concludes with a summation of the current state of the field and some recommendations on how to take strategy-as-practice research forward.},

@article{Bruce1999,
  abstract = {The idea of information literacy, broadly defined as the ability to recognise information needs and identify, evaluate and use information effectively, has been of growing concern in the education sectors for a number of years; whilst in the workplace, employers and managers have perhaps attended more to the need for computer and information technology skill. New descriptions of information literacy, that may be of value to the business sector, are now beginning to appear as a result of qualitative research into how professional employees experience the effective use of information. This paper summarises the outcomes of an investigation into the experience of information literacy amongst various types of professionals; and explores the possible differences and interrelations between individual and organisational information literacy suggested by these outcomes. Seven different ways of experiencing information literacy were identified. These experiences are closely related to important workplace processes such as environmental scanning, information man-agement, corporate memory, and research and development; confirming that information literacy should be considered a significant part of the character of learning organisations as well as being a key characteristic of the organisation’s employees. Implications of individual and organisational information literacy for beginning and continuing professional education are explored.},

@article{CrawfordIrving2009,
  abstract = {Although increasingly recognized as a future skills issue, the use of information in the workplace is a little studied area within library and information research. A substantial `pedagogic' literature of learning in the workplace exists, however, and this was critically reviewed to generate a repertoire of issues which could in turn be used to inform a research project. This repertoire was supplemented by advice from the Scottish Information Literacy Project's partners and contacts including those working in Adult Literacies. These issues were used to generate research questions for an interview-based project which, it was hoped, would generate both action points and further research questions. With the help of partners a range of interviewees was identified, mainly in the public sector. Information usage in the workplace, as the pedagogic literature predicted, proved to be a form of social interaction with people, both within and outside the organization, being generally the prime source of information. Other sources included intranets, electronic resource data management systems, a limited range of Internet sites and a small number of printed sources. Recommendations include the need to establish contacts with chambers of commerce, skills agencies and trade unions. Public libraries should explore the possibility of developing information literacy training programmes.},

This paper draws on an evolutionary theory of economic growth that brings together appreciative theorizing regarding growth and formal theorizing. It aims to piece together a relatively coherent appreciative theoretical account of economic development at a sectoral level by laying out a story of the growth, and development, of a manufacturing sector, from birth to maturity, and perhaps until death, that seems to fit many cases and which can serve as a target for formalization. The paper first describes and tries to link two broad bodies of appreciative evolutionary theoretic writing. The first proposes that a new technology develops along a relatively standard track from the time it is born, to its maturity, and that firm and industry structure ‘coevolve’ with the technology. The other is concerned with the development of institutions in response to changing economic conditions, incentives, and pressures. The paper then considers ‘punctuated equilibrium’ before concluding with a consideration of two economic developmental implications that appear to flow from the analysis. One concerns the pattern of change of productivity, of capital intensity, and relative variables associated with economic growth, as a technology and industry structure develop. The other is concerned with implicitly cross-country comparisons, and is focused on how ‘comparative advantage’ develops in a new industry.}",

By making apparent the indirect ties bearing on actors, the triad is the smallest unit of analysis for a network. Despite extensive conceptual and empirical work, little systematic attention is given to the triad in the marketing literature. This article reviews literature spanning multiple academic disciplines and makes three contributions. First, it provides an overview of the triad concept combining sociological insights with more recent work emerging in operations management and marketing. Second, the article identifies three distinct forms of triadic relationships in existing literature: (1) brokerage, focused on the action of the third between two others; (2) mediation, describing different mechanisms by which a dyadic relationship affects and is affected by a relationship with a third party; and (3) coalition, capturing the configuration and evolution of ties in the three-actor system as a whole. Finally, this article develops an initial research agenda for triadic marketing research. }

The precise source of the model remains nebulous, having never been documented. Several authors who have used, improved, or criticized the model in the past fifty years rarely acknowledged or cited any original source. The model usually was taken for granted. According to others, however, it comes directly from V. Bush's Science: The Endless Frontier ([1945] 1995). This article traces the history of the linear model, suggesting that it developed in three steps corresponding to three scientific communities looking at science analytically. The article argues that statistics is a main reason the model is still alive despite criticisms, alternatives, and having been proclaimed dead.}

ABSTRACT = {The Triple Helix concept of innovation systems holds that consensus space among industry, government and university is required to bring together their competences to achieve enhanced economic and social development on a systemic scale. In line with this argument, this article analyses empirically how the concept of circular economy is conceived in the institutional spheres of “industry”, “government” and “university”. Innovation systems are constantly being reconstructed through knowledge production and communication, which is reflected in how concepts develop in the different spheres. By applying natural language processing tools to key contributions from each of the three spheres (the “Triple Helix”), it is shown that, although institutional backgrounds do contribute to differing conceptualizations of circular economy, there is a substantial but limited conceptual consensus space, which, according to the Triple Helix, should open new opportunities for innovations. The consensus space shared across the three spheres focuses on materials and products and sees circular economy as a way to create new resources, businesses and products from waste. The industry sphere highlights business opportunities on global scale, which are also evident in the government sphere. The government sphere connects circular economy to waste-related innovation policies targeted at industrial renewal, economic growth, investments and jobs. The university sphere, in turn, focuses on production and environmental issues, waste and knowledge, and is rather distinct from the two other spheres. The importance of the differing conceptions of circular economy is based on the logic of Triple Helix systems. Accordingly, sufficient consensus between the Triple Helix spheres can advance the application of the concept of circular economy beyond the individual spheres to achieve systemic changes.},

    abstract = { The Triple Helix model of innovation systems is widely diffused. The fundamental idea of the model is that ‘university’ can play an enhanced role in innovation in knowledge-based societies and that the three helices – ‘university’, ‘industry’ and ‘government’ – interact in order to produce innovation and therefore regional and national economic growth. This is, however, only one model among several different systemic approaches for explaining regional differences in innovativeness. While the triple helix model emphasizes the role of the university for regional innovativeness, the other systemic approaches call attention to either industry or government as having the lead role in innovation. Further, the triple helix model is developed and primarily explored from a macro-level perspective and not from a firm-level perspective. Finally, while the theoretical value of triple helix interactions are reasonably confirmed, there are still gaps in the triple helix concept, and the practical value is only just beginning to realize its potential. From a firm-level perspective, the purpose of this article is therefore to test the applicability and practical value of the triple helix model when exploring the formation and growth of firms using the case of Google Inc. Useful when exploring a firm’s formation and growth, the triple helix model forces the exploration to start even before the entrepreneur enters the scene, which provides a more holistic picture of firm formation. The three helices were all found to play important but changing roles in the different phases of firm formation and growth. The Google case contributes further understanding of the nature and historical evolution of interactions between the three helices, thereby filling some gaps in the triple helix concept. The Google case also identifies a number of mechanisms for interaction and the important role of the bridging organizations that connect the helices and contribute to the development of interactions. Finally, the concept of ‘spaces’ proved relevant and useful, although in the perspective of a firm, the concept has a broader meaning and exists on different levels. }

    abstract = { Innovation is increasingly based upon a “Triple Helix” of university-industry-government interactions. The increased importance of knowledge and the role of the university in incubation of technology-based firms has given it a more prominent place in the institutional firmament. The entrepreneurial university takes a proactive stance in putting knowledge to use and in broadening the input into the creation of academic knowledge. Thus it operates according to an interactive rather than a linear model of innovation. As firms raise their technological level, they move closer to an academic model, engaging in higher levels of training and in sharing of knowledge. Government acts as a public entrepreneur and venture capitalist in addition to its traditional regulatory role in setting the rules of the game. Moving beyond product development, innovation then becomes an endogenous process of “taking the role of the other”, encouraging hybridization among the institutional spheres. }

abstract = {Community empowerment is one of the main purpose of development in developing countries. While development only result in a ratio between the “before” and “after” condition, empowerment can keep the continuity of the development through the good relationship between related parties, in terms of knowledge production and field application. Since the parties in community empowerment are tightly related with Triple-Helix model, Non-governmental organization (NGO), as a non-profit organization in community empowerment projects, should catch its opportunities as the axis of those three helixes. The case of Nias community empowerment on cocoa production presents some lessons which seek to illustrate the links between parties in a community empowerment project. While each helix make their movements by themself, the NGO fill-in the gap in the interactions between the helixs as well as interaction among each helix. The convergence between helixs build the opportunities for each connection, so it is analyzed carefully through internal informations to find the most appropriate relationship in the field. By focusing on the gathering of new thought of the Triple-Helix approach, this paper proposes a simple model as the initial step to develop new applications of the concept, then emerges a new thought that Triple-Helix can be implemented in wider phenomenon among societies, and give opportunities for further research around it.}

About one hour is considered a reasonable maximum length for SSIs in order to minimize fatigue for both interviewer and respondent. This chapter begins with a discussion on the disadvantages and advantages of SSIs. Despite the disadvantages and costs of SSIs, they offer some extraordinary benefits as well. Semi-structured interviews are superbly suited for a number of valuable tasks, particularly when more than a few of the open-ended questions require follow-up queries. The chapter presents some recommendations that can be considered when constructing an SSI guide. All in all, effectively conducted semi-structured interviews, even though labor intensive, should be worth the effort in terms of the insights and information gained.}

abstract = {This paper proposes to review and assess social scientific debate about the origins and nature of innovation in modern society. It focuses on three sub-sets of conceptualisation, critique and commentary that refer specifically to sub-national or regional innovation systems. Research in the latter field has grown enormously in recent years. Moreover, new perspectives from other disciplines than regional science have been promoted. One distinctive view of relevance in that it is focused on the role in innovation of specific ‘entrepreneurial universities’ in relation to industry and government is, of course, the ‘Triple Helix’ approach. This is reviewed and sympathetically critiqued. A second view, less sympathetically critiqued here, is one that itself attacks all so-called ‘new regionalism’ for stressing the importance of institutions, industry embeddedness and the micro-science of regional economic development. Dazzled by ‘Globalisation 1’ and the totalising power of ‘scale’ geographies, this rejection of the worth of spatial analysis at less than the global or national ‘scalar envelope’ is assessed for its potential insights into weaknesses of the regional innovation systems approach but found wanting in both technical accuracy and scholarly competence. Finally, the state of the art in regional innovation systems research is sketched by reference both to recent longitudinal findings and elaborations into specific technological fields, particularly but not only Bioregional Innovation Systems that help move us towards a newer theory of economic geography in the knowledge economy, based on ‘regional knowledge capabilities.’ The analysis conclusively proposes ‘Globalisation 2’, a ‘ground-up’ knowledge-driven evolution of the earlier ‘top–down’ multilateral trade institution and corporately driven ‘Globalisation 1.’}

This perspective is at the root of the development of various innovation concepts. The systematic study of different systems of innovation has raised the awareness that each particular system has its own characteristics, and that it is not always possible to unilaterally define all the parameters that play a role in shaping innovation processes. The article describes the main obstacles facing public policy decision-making drawing on examples from innovation and research policy.

We question this assumption, suggesting that not all such linkages are equally helpful. In this paper, we explore the factors driving the formation of ‘valuable U–I linkages’, conceived as those linkages between universities and firms that have a higher potential to diffuse knowledge to other firms in their regional economy. Our empirical strategy combines case-study methodology with econometric techniques using data from two wine clusters in Chile and in Italy. The firm's knowledge base is found to be a key driver of ‘valuable’ U–I linkages. We conclude that selectivity should be encouraged among policy makers endeavouring to promote U–I linkages.}

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This paper takes a critical stand towards the Mode-2 thesis and the Triple-Helix model as schemes to describe the association of university research with applied motives and commercial and industrial actors. By drawing from a case study of a plant-biotechnology research group, which transformed into a start-up company, the paper suggests that using these models as conceptual frameworks in the empirical analysis may run the risk of glossing over some vital conceptual insights. The first instance where more focused attention should be given is the analytic distinction between theoretical, methodological and applied dimensions of a local research program. By appreciating it, a central source of dynamic that formed the ground for the commercialization of the group’s research results is preserved. The second deficiency is that neither the Mode 2 nor the Triple Helix pays close enough attention to the problems and contradictions that come into the world as university research results are commercialized. In this respect, three problem areas are addressed: 1) the ownership of intellectual property rights, 2) the industrial collaboration and the difficulties of transferring the research results to the market, and 3) the failed attempt of creating a hybrid community between the research group and the spin-off company. Also these should be given a more central role in the models since they seem to be vital challenges for researchers-entrepreneurs as they move from academic to industrial focus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Science \& Technology Studies}, author={Tuunainen, Juha}, year={2002}, month={Jan.}, pages={36–58} }

But scholarship on the role of universities in the innovation process, as opposed to their role in basic research, has grown rapidly since 1970. One important theme in this research is the reconceptualization of universities as important institutional actors in national and regional systems of innovation. Rather than “ivory towers” devoted to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, a growing number of industrial-economy and developing-economy governments seek to use universities as instruments for knowledge-based economic development and change.}",

abstract = {Social innovations (SIs) are new ideas that create collaboration or new social relationships and thus meet local needs. The purpose of the research is to understand the role of SIs and community-based quadruple-helix actors in rural development. The research question is how do community-based quadruple-helix actors contribute to the formation of SI networks in the context of rural development? The triple helix model represents innovations as emerging in cooperation between three helices (university, industry, and government). The quadruple helix (QH) adds civil society as a fourth helix. Using the QH model in rural development requires a broad definition of the helices. In addition to universities, all types of educational and research institutes are important. In addition, different types of public organisations are important, not just the government. We define the fourth helix as representing civil society as a community, not just individual citizens. Our main argument is that the QH model fosters understanding of the variety of formal and informal ways in which SI enables societal development in rural areas. We examine the relevant relationships with the help of the strands of literature on SI and QH, and also a case study on projects conducted under the LEADER programme (Aktion Österbotten) in Finland. The case study is based on a narrative approach inspired by the learning history method, with the identification of critical incidents, which help us to identify how the QH evolves throughout successful community-driven SIs. The narrative approach reveals the significance of informal communities in transforming QH relations. Many projects under the LEADER programme aim to strengthen the attraction of communities by promoting local identity, including broad participation in collective events, such as enjoying nature, cultural events, sports, and other social activities. Many of those activities have the potential to spill over into other types of SI, such as entrepreneurship oriented towards tourism and new solutions to social needs. The decisive factor for the success of the projects was the involvement of local communities. The local knowledge of the communities was nourished in the projects in interaction with other local and extra-local QH actors. Accordingly, the main contribution of the paper is combining the notions of SI and the QH, and presenting the fourth helix as a community enabling rural development. We call this rural development model the community-driven QH model.}
