# OSBBS - One Steep Back Before Submiting ... your paper to a publisher 

# Problem statement
Researchers produce original articles in Latex that are publication ready in pdf,  to be asked then by some editorial office to : 
* Put all footnotes in the end 
* Put all figures in the end or submit them separately  
* Put all tables in the end or submit them separately 
* Submit the work in the proprietary, expensive and  non-interoperable Microsoft Word format.  
  
Then after review and acceptance, publishers will send the word file to a offshore location (usually India),
where they will typeset (i.e., create a pdf that is to be printed or distributed online) and produce a final document 
that can be even worst that the original articles formatted in Latex by the original author. 

This is high inneficient, why ACM, IEEE and other academic associations recevive and publish directly the work by researcher, other tranditional publishers in general, 
or specific journals in particular force authors to submit their work in MS word. While I agree that most researcher in social sciences do not want to learn Latex, PdfLatex, Overleaf
or anything new rather than the the proprietary, expensive and  non-interoperable Microsoft Word format, the others should not be forced to use MS word. In my view, MS word is a really 
bad format for articles that are complex with a lot of tables, high-resolution figures, lot of references, lot of footnotes that are co-written by multiple scholars at the same time. 

We can not change the world, but with obsbbs, we can automate  some of the common old-school requests (e.g., put footnotes at end, all figures in separate files) in osbbs. A simple 
step back to before submiting you article to a journal that does not welcome good looking, latex produced, publication ready submissions. 

Just run **osbbs** againt you latex main file (e.g., main.tex) and **osbbs** will help you address many of the common requests by the editorial offices that love the MS WORD format.   

# Vision

A world where researchers use Latex instead of word
